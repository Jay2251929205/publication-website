Today we are very honored to have Professor and Director Kevin Mo here, for SciEcon AMA. Today, we will discuss the conversation on Cryptography, Trust Machine, and the Cyber Planet Construction. Thank you so much for being here with us, Kevin Mo. Prof. Kevin Mo: Thank you! Question 1 Prof. Luyao Zhang: We know that you are the Director of Blockchain and Privacy-Preserving Computation Center, Beijing Big Data Research Institute. What is your motivation for doing research in the fields of blockchain and privacy-preserving computation ? Prof. Kevin Mo: I would like to answer this question by drawing a parallel between the physical world and the cyber world. Humanity as a species has been living in the physical world throughout its long evolution history tracing back to the time when life was born on earth. Great amounts of accumulated experiences and knowledge gradually developed into systematic scientific theories such as Newtonian mechanics [1], Einstein\u2019s relativity [2], quantum physics [3], and so on, which attempted to capture the natural laws of the physical world. The understanding of these natural laws made it possible for human beings to observe and manipulate elements of the physical world, namely various forms of matter and energy, with great precision and accuracy. This became the foundation of technological developments such as the invention of automobiles, airplanes, satellites, semiconductors, lasers, GPS, and so on, which provided much comfort and convenience to humans living in the physical world. Since the inception of business Internet in 1994 ( Charmonman et al, 1994 ), humanity has started a process of rapid migration from the physical world to this newly created cyber world, which has been growing every day, and becoming more and more like our second home. This cyber world is similar to the physical world in the sense that both are kind of \u201cplaces\u201d where we can \u201clive in\u201d, namely, to conduct various activities, to interact with each other, and to enjoy. On the other hand, the cyber world is also very different from the physical world, with its own peculiar properties. It has its own natural laws, and therefore must have its own sciences and corresponding technologies. What are they? My personal answer is: the so-called \u201cprivacy-preserving computation\u201d, in its theoretical aspect, namely the science of advanced cryptography, is nothing but the science of the cyber world. It began with Diffie and Hellman\u2019s groundbreaking paper in 1976 , and now includes things like zero-knowledge proofs [5], homomorphic encryption [6], secure multi-party computation [7], and so on. It is the result of many important scientific discoveries (comparable to Einstein\u2019s discovery of relativity) made in the past 45 years or so, capturing fundamental natural laws of cyberspace [4]. These natural laws are quite subtle and intricate, often counterintuitive, in the sense that many seemingly impossible things are shown to be possible. They are more abstract than Newton\u2019s gravity, not so easy to grasp without some mathematical thinking. Figure 2: Zero-Knowledge Proofs Along with the scientific exploration, technological development of the cyber world takes form around 1995 when SSL/TLS was developed in Netscape Navigator. This PKI/HTTPS technology [8] was the first attempt to bring some order to the new cyber world, which made e-commerce possible. But the true milestone was the invention of the blockchain ( Nakamoto, 2009 ), which for the first time demonstrated the possibility of constructing a self-governing \u201ccivilized cybercity\u201d, which seems entirely independent of the physical world. We summarize the above in the following formulas: privacy-preserving computation = science of cyberspace blockchain = technology of cyberspace (in today\u2019s form) Figure 3: Visualization of Science and Technology of Cyberspace Question 2 Tianyu Wu: We all know the importance of the Internet and cyberspace as you put it. But this really involves the whole field of \u201ccomputer science\u201d, right? Why do you give special importance to privacy-preserving computation and blockchain technology? Prof. Kevin Mo: Yes, this brings us to the central point of the matter, which is TRUST construction. In my view, cyberspace today as a whole is still like the planet Mars, not quite ready for human habitation. Great ecological transformation is needed to make it a truly livable planet. The central factor of this transformation is the formation of an overall ground of TRUST, upon which other social and economic constructions can be built. The blockchain revolution that started in 2009 was a major breakthrough in this direction. But much more is still needed. In the physical world, civilized human living requires stable supplies of food, shelter, clothing, and basic social structure such as families, tribes, or more advanced forms of social governance, which provides the basic sense of security. In the case of cyberspace, a similar sense of security is also needed, so that its inhabitants can interact with each other in trust and confidence. Trust in cyberspace is as basic as food and shelter in the physical world. To come back to your question, my answer can be summarized as follow: privacy-preserving computation = science of trust blockchain = technology of trust (in today\u2019s form) Figure 4: Visualization of Science and Technology of Trust We add the qualification \u201cin today\u2019s form\u201d because there is the feeling that blockchain technology is likely to evolve into some much more sophisticated form in the future and may not be called \u201cblockchain\u201d anymore. Figure 5: Cybertrust Now, what do we mean by trust? Roughly speaking, in a multiparty cooperative mechanism, trust means the confidence that everything will happen only within pre-defined rules. More precisely, every party can \u201cdo things\u201d and \u201cknow things\u201d only within those rules. To get a more concrete idea, just imagine four persons playing a game of bridge. A set of rules specifies what each party can do and can know. So, we have the following formula: Trust = Proper Behavior Enforcement + Privacy Figure 6: Trust which captures the two fundamental aspects of trust. In this view, we realize that the term privacy-preserving computation is partial in its meaning. A more accurate terminology should be: Trust Computation = Theory of Advanced Cryptography Trust Engineering = Blockchain (and Its Future Variants) Figure 7: Trust Computation and Trust Engineering Question 3 Xinyu Tian: From your description above, you seem to imply that the construction of trust in cyberspace is not a small task, and we are still in the beginning stage of this work. If this is the case, could you elaborate further, so that we get a more concrete idea of what you mean by trust construction, and also an overall picture of what lies in the future? Prof. Kevin Mo: Yes, I do think trust construction in cyberspace is essentially the building of entirely new infrastructure. In terms of the time period, it would be reasonable to think on a scale of say 30\u201350 years. We can compare it with the building of the Internet, which is essentially an infrastructure of connectivity. It has been going on for nearly 30 years by now, and we cannot quite say it has reached its full maturity. But as we will see more clearly along with our discussion, \u201ctrust\u201d is something much more complex and sophisticated than \u201cconnectivity\u201d. So we cannot expect it to be done very quickly. Now, let\u2019s try to understand the matter from a historic perspective and see how the science of cryptography helps to build step by step an increasingly more powerful trust infrastructure for human society. For the sake of explanation, I will divide it into four development stages. Trust 1.0: Symmetric Cryptography This goes back to the time of Julius Caesar [9] (or even earlier) and reached a high degree of maturity in the 1970s when the Data Encryption Standard (DES) was published. It was a technology of secure communication that represented the first step of trust construction for human interaction in the \u201cinformation space\u201d. There was no cyberspace as we understand today, but you can also think there was a kind of cyberspace in its infancy. One thing to realize is that it has taken humanity 2000 years to reach this stage. Even if we count from the beginning of the 20th century, it has still taken decades of time to mature the technology. In this case, maturity means, first of all, that the encryption is practically unbreakable in a strong enough sense. Figure 8: Symmetric Cryptography Trust 2.0: Public-Key Cryptography, PKI/HTTPS Public-key cryptography was discovered around 1976 ( Diffie and Hellman, 1976 ), which opened entirely new possibilities. 20 years later, around 1995, it was used in the design of SSL/TLS[10] in the HTTPS protocol. Together with the hierarchy of PKI (public-key infrastructure), a certain trust system was established, so that general e-commerce became possible. Individuals and institutions were confident enough to input their private information on a web page for business transactions. Figure 9: Public-Key Cryptography Nowadays, HTTPS and e-commerce have become so commonplace, so we forgot that this had been a great technical achievement, which would not be possible without its scientific foundation (public-key cryptography). This was the first step of bringing trust to cyberspace. But this approach still depends heavily on the existing trust system of the physical world. It also followed the traditional logic of relying on some third-party authorities. Trust 3.0: Nakamoto\u2019s Blockchain, Half Trust Machine Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s Bitcoin in 2009 brought an entirely new conception of trust to human society. It effectively constructed an intrinsic trust system within cyberspace itself, with almost no reference to the physical world. Cooperative parties can deal with each other without know the other party\u2019s physical identity or other physical attributes and conditions. Blockchain is then also called a TRUST MACHINE. What exactly is a trust machine? Nakamoto\u2019s original vision is clear. The main purpose is to be free of the traditional reliance on \u201ctrust third party\u201d (TTP) [11]. Through a distributed protocol based on cryptography (plus some economic principles), one effectively creates a \u201cvirtual TTP\u201d which functions almost like a real TTP. This is to say, Bitcoin functions almost like a real bank, without having such a bank. This is the meaning of the trust machine. A trusted machine is nothing but a set of distributed computer programs that collectively function almost like a TTP, without actually having that TTP. But things are not so simple yet. Does Bitcoin truly function as a real bank? The answer is \u201cnot quite\u201d, and there is some vital difference. A real bank maintains strict privacy for its customers, while Bitcoin simply doesn\u2019t have that ability. All accounting information of Bitcoin is open to the public. Nakamoto was clearly aware of this weakness and suggested a few remedies in the latter part of his original 2008 paper, which was not a real solution at all. But Bitcoin has been functioning fine so far despite this weakness. This is largely because the world of Bitcoin now operates quite independently from the physical world, so that the privacy problem can be tolerated. But if you want to use blockchain in real-world business applications, this will not work anymore. Real business data is almost always highly confidential. The above analysis is leading to an important conclusion. Nakamoto\u2019s blockchain is not yet a \u201ctrust machine\u201d, so we call it a \u201chalf trust machine\u201d. As such, it is incapable of delivering most of its promises to society under the vague idea of a \u201ctrust machine\u201d. You might ask, who made those promises? Maybe nobody in particular, but there was just a huge collectively created misunderstanding. To put this issue in focus, let\u2019s just look at one business use case: to build a fully decentralized stock exchange which can replace NYSE and NASDAQ, in which quotations from traders are strictly confidential information. Careful examination of this case should convince you that Nakamoto\u2019s blockchain is incapable of this task. More generally speaking, Nakamoto\u2019s blockchain is mostly unusable for real business applications. Is there a solution to the above problem? To answer this question is really the central theme of our conversation. Figure 10: Bitcoin Trust 4.0: Trust Computation, Full Trust Machine Seeing the inadequacy of blockchain as a \u201chalf trust machine\u201d, is there such a thing in the world that can be called a \u201cfull trust machine\u201d? One may be surprised to learn that such a trust machine has been discovered long ago before blockchain. The prototype of which was given in Shamir, Rivest, and Adleman\u2019s 1979 paper: Mental Poker , (the same authors discovered the famous RSA algorithm in 1978). The paper raised a very strange question: Can two potentially dishonest players play a fair game of poker using no cards (e.g. over the phone)? Hearing such a question, almost everybody should answer \u201cimpossible\u201d. But contrary to your expectation, the paper provided a positive solution. Think about this more carefully. You may realize how peculiar and how amazing this is. Figure 11: Trust Machine I personally regard this as a great scientific discovery of information science. Using today\u2019s concepts, this may be thought of as a fundamental discovery about cyberspace, comparable to Newton\u2019s discovery of gravity about the physical world. This was 30 years ahead of blockchain, and from scientific point of view, a far superior achievement than blockchain. It accomplished something that the blockchain is incapable of, namely the formation of mutual trust in full privacy. To be more precise, it means the construction of a certain mathematical communication procedure between two persons, so that they can engage in a certain interactive game (such as poker), in which each party cannot know anything about what happens in the other party (unless allowed by the rules), and yet cheating is not possible. Because thou hast seen me, thou hast believed: blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have believed. John 20:29 [12] . The above initial discovery was studied further by Andrew Yao (1982) with the famous millionaire\u2019s problem, which gave birth to a new branch of cryptography, secure multiparty computation (MPC). In its most general formulation, the problem MPC intends to solve is exactly the construction of a \u201cfull trust machine\u201d, namely an interactive protocol which functions \u201cfully\u201d as a trusted third party (TTP). During the 1980s, the above goal had been fully achieved under very general assumptions (such as the number of adversaries is less than \u00bd, or less than 1/3, and so on). Figure 12: Secure Multi-Party Computation After all the above explanation, let\u2019s jump to a general statement: the vague vision of blockchain as trust machine, as entertained by many people in the society, the business community, or even many blockchain professionals, cannot be realized by blockchain alone. But it can be realized through advanced cryptography (alone or in combination with blockchain), which includes sophisticated schemes such as zero knowledge proofs, homomorphic encryption, secure multiparty computation, and so on. This constitutes the true promised land of trust construction in cyberspace. Question 4 Prof. Luyao Zhang: You distinguished \u201chalf trust machine\u201d from \u201cfull trust machine\u201d. Can you go further into the exact difference between the two? Prof. Kevin Mo: OK, let\u2019s go into the mental poker problem in a little more detail. Consider two poker players, A in San Francisco, B in New York, and they want to play a game on phone. How would they do that? The easiest solution is to find a third person C, whom both A and B trustfully. With the help of C, A, and B can play the game easily. Now, what do we mean by trusting C? It includes two aspects: 1) C must ensure both players follow the rules of the game; 2) C must not reveal any more information to each party than prescribed by the rule of the game. Now, the whole point of the \u201cmental poker problem\u201d is to realize the above function of C through a telephone conversation between A and B, without having the actual person (or a machine) C. In other words, one must design such a special form of conversation (called a protocol) such that it emulates C\u2019s job in both aspects: 1) rule enforcement; 2) information hiding (privacy). Blockchain can emulate the first aspect, but not the second. Blockchain can emulate chess (which contains no private information), but not poker. Let\u2019s summarize our analysis in the following formulas: half trust machine = phone call which can emulate chess game full trust machine = phone call which can emulate poker game What\u2019s the implication of this to business? Now, consider any real-world multiparty business cooperation, would it be more like a chess game or a poker game? We have talked about the case of a fully decentralized stock exchange, which trades not a cryptocurrency, but real stocks. We can also think of the auction market, restate agency business, and so on. You can analyze dozens of business use cases, and come to realize that almost all valuable cases are more like poker rather than chess, namely that privacy is an absolute requirement. Conclusion: blockchain without advanced cryptography is only a \u201chalf trust machine\u201d which has only limited value in real-world business applications. The future lies in the construction of a \u201cfull trust machine\u201d through advanced cryptography (possibly in combination with blockchain). Question 5 Tianyu Wu: What you said seems to make sense. But if as you said, a much more advanced and powerful theory/technology you named \u201ctrust 4.0\u201d already existed in the 1980s, then why is there still a place for blockchain which came much later in time? Prof. Kevin Mo: Good question. So far, we have emphasized the vital limitation of blockchain as a \u201chalf trust machine\u201d. But to gain a full picture of the situation, we need also to understand a few other important points. Point 1: General Purpose \u201cFull Trust Machine\u201d is Not Practical Today because of High Cost Full trust machine in its most general form has been accomplished in the 1980s in MPC theory. However, the computation/communication cost required is very high. Great improvements have been made during the past 15 years or so. But it\u2019s still quite far from being practical. A full trust machine could also be constructed using fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) schemes (the first such scheme was constructed by Craig Gentry\u2019s Stanford thesis in 2009, which had been a great breakthrough in cryptography). These schemes allow arbitrary computation to be performed on encrypted data without decryption. But it also suffers a similar performance cost problem. Using the best-optimized scheme today, FHE\u2019s computation cost is still about 1,000\u201310,000 times of ordinary computation. Figure 13: Fully Homomorphic Encryption Trust Machine is a truly revolutionary concept that can change the underlying foundation of human society, including business as well as social governance in general. However, its full realization does incur such a high cost that it\u2019s not practical available yet. In contrast, blockchain as a half trust machine, has the advantage of being immediately available. Acting as a kind of \u201ctoy car\u201d technology, it allows the society at large to play with it, and get familiar with many of the new concepts involved. Bitcoin, Ethereum, DeFi, NFT, GameFi, Metaverse are among such experimentations that have been conducted at scale, without waiting for the true technology of \u201cfull trust machine\u201d. Point 2: Why Blockchain as a \u201cToy Car\u201d Solution Is Still So Successful? The phenomenal success of blockchain since 2009 testify to the ingenuity of its design. The idea of replacing TTP with a distributed protocol is expressly stated in Nakamoto\u2019s paper. But unlike MPC theory which tackled the problem in its full generality, Bitcoin focused only on one simple case: electronic cash payment system, which simplifies the problem greatly. Let\u2019s look into a number of factors which contributed to its success. 1) By focusing on the payment system, it needs to deal only with simple mathematics of addition and subtraction mostly. This made the system very light. 2) Nakamoto left the problem of privacy unsolved. Bitcoin (and other cryptocurrencies) practically got away with this problem by the fact that users\u2019 crypto identities (their public keys and private keys) are not linked to their physical identity. 3) Blockchain introduced an economical (or game-theoretical) principle into the protocol. So, its security depends not only on cryptography, but also on the economic interests of the participants. In other words, to attack the system may not be in their best business interests. This is indeed a new contribution made by blockchain design. 4) It created and issued new \u201ccurrency\u201d out of nothing, which practically caused a continuous flow of transition of wealth from society in general to the crypto community. It may sound a bit like robbery, but we will not get into moral issues here. In any case, it provides a powerful channel of financing to the community so that continuous innovation, development, and system maintenance are well supported. All these contributed to the quick rise of blockchain. The vital issue of privacy has largely been evaded, but not resolved. It will prevent blockchain from going very far into real-world business applications. Question 6 Xinyu Tian: You have just described two cases: on the one hand is the general-purpose full trust machine, which is good in theory but impractical due to the high cost. On the other hand, is blockchain as a half trust machine that cannot maintain privacy, and therefore not good enough for business use. So, what is the way out? Prof. Kevin Mo: Interestingly, besides the two extreme cases, there seems to be a vast promised land in between. One particularly interesting approach is the combination of blockchain with zero-knowledge proofs. To appreciate the value of this approach, let\u2019s look into another vital defect of the original blockchain design: the extreme inefficiency of the system due to the requirement that every miner must repeat all the work of bookkeeping. As a result, blockchain\u2019s computation and storage capacities are extremely limited. These fundamental difficulties are also expressed as Vitalik\u2019s blockchain trilemma among decentralization, security, and scalability. As it turned out, Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) proves to be a powerful tool to solve these problems. Simply put, both the privacy problem and the efficiency problem. Historically speaking, Nakamoto\u2019s Bitcoin paper in 2008 was preceded by a series of sophisticated research in e-cash, in which the ideas of using ZKP had been explored extensively. Bitcoin did not use any of it, but the ideas were around in the circle. An important development was the appearance of the Pinocchio protocol in 2013, which for the first time brought the performance of general-purpose ZKP to a practical level. This was then implemented in Zcash and launched in 2016, which demonstrated the power of ZKP in facilitating mutual trust in full privacy. After Zcash, some other different cases were developed, each demonstrating the power of ZKP from a different angle. Together they seem to indicate a very promising direction for the near future. The following are some of the interesting cases: 1. The transition from Proof-of-Work (PoW) [13] to Proof-of-Stake [14] through the use of Verifiable Random Function (VRF) [15] which has in it the element of ZKP, and we see this in the research of Algorand , Ouroboros , DFINITY and Dusk Network . 2. Ethereum scalability through zk-rollup , which expands the computation and storage capacity of the main chain by delegating those tasks to off-chain resources, while ensuring the correctness of those computations through ZKP. 3. Dusk Network expands on Zcash and aims to support real-world security trading (going outside the crypto world), in which privacy is a requirement, not an option. 4. FileCoin uses Verifiable Delay Functions (VDF) ( Boneh et al, 2019 ) and Proof-of-Storage (PoS) [16]. We see ZKP in the role of creating trust among different parties so that they can work together in coordination to form a single larger system. 5. Mina uses a sophisticated form of ZKP called \u201crecursive proof\u201d ( Bowe et al, 2019 ) to achieve something quite amazing. It manages to compress the whole blockchain into the size of 22k, so that even a very light node (say an old mobile phone) can participate in the process of verification. This technology may be used to prevent the situation as in for example Bitcoin where power got more and more concentrated in a small number of mining pools. 6. zkEVM represents a more recent effort to provide a comprehensive solution in this general direction. Some time is still needed for us to see how successful it may be. In summary, this approach aims to develop a blockchain system which can fully satisfy the two major demands of real-world business applications: 1) absolute privacy; 2) reasonable level of performance. Viewing as a trust machine, it lies in the middle ground between the two extreme cases as you asked. Question 7 Prof. Luyao Zhang: It\u2019s exciting to hear about all the progress with this approach of combining blockchain with ZKP. How would you put it in the bigger picture of trust machine construction? Prof. Kevin Mo: As discussed earlier, a general purpose \u201cfull trust machine\u201d, which fully emulates an all-powerful TTP, is the ideal technology that lies at the heart of the vision of decentralization. However, this ideal technology exists only in theory today. Even with the best-optimized algorithms, the best available commercial hardware, and the best attainable network speed, its implementation would still be too slow. So, this technology is not quite ready yet for large-scale adoption by the industry. The blockchain + ZKP approach is different. It is fast enough to be usable now. Naturally, it cannot be \u201cgeneral purpose\u201d. It can only handle specific class of multiparty computations. So, we may call it special purpose \u201cfull trust machine\u201d. It is \u201cfull\u201d in the sense of fulfilling both demands of trust, namely: 1) proper behavior enforcement; 2) privacy. Regarding the \u201cspecial purpose\u201d aspect, how special exactly? This is something that needs to be clarified by further research. One point to be noted is, this approach seems to work well only with tasks which do not require complex computations with a lot of data mixing among different parties. But fortunately, it does cover a very wide range of valuable business applications. One can reasonably expect the gradual realization of its enormous potential in the next 20\u201330 years. What about complex computations with a lot of data mixing among different parties? Again, useful computational tasks are usually not so \u201cgeneric\u201d. To the specific class of computations, specific optimization may be found. If not, then in principle, it may really require general-purpose MPC schemes, or full homomorphic encryption schemes, which are very costly. An alternative to that is the hardware solutions based on TEE [17]. It is fast enough, but then you will need to trust the hardware vendors for security. Another approach to the privacy problem is through access control. This approach is used extensively by the so-called permissioned blockchain. But it this approach appears to have a fundamental conceptual weakness. By keeping certain data private from a certain party, also renders the data totally unusable by that party. This is not the kind of privacy we really want, because it defeats the very purpose of a trust machine. The whole point of a trust machine is to be able to use those data without seeing them. This leads us to the following view: blockchain schemes heavily based on access control seem to have deviated from the vision of the trust machine fundamentally. This deviation naturally carries over to the business application level. The power of blockchain as a disruptive technology may be lost to a very large degree. Some people may think otherwise on this point, but let time tell it. Question 8 Tianyu Wu: Can you briefly envision the future society in Cyberspace by highlighting some of your research interests in blockchain and cryptography? Prof. Kevin Mo: It has taken humanity a few thousand years to build the whole physical infrastructure on earth which is the foundation of modern civilized living, with all its comfort and convenience. A similar process of construction is also needed for the newly born cyber planet, and the very foundation of this construction is the technology of the trust machine. The first social experiment on the trust machine is Bitcoin started in 2009. It is somewhat of a miracle that it succeeded on its first trial, with millions of users today, and a market cap of $1 trillion which ranks among the top 10 public companies in the world. Along with the growth of Bitcoin, we see an explosive development of various types of trust machine technologies. Most of them are based on either blockchain, or a combination of blockchain with something else. It has taken humanity a few thousand years to build the whole physical infrastructure on earth which is the foundation of modern civilized living, with all its comfort and convenience.

Along with the growth of Bitcoin, we see an explosive development of various types of trust machine technologies. Most of them are based on either blockchain, or a combination of blockchain with something else. It is a very young age. So, we expect to see a long period when people will try many lines of development. However, I have the feeling that all these different developments will gradually merge into one Global Trust Machine, or Global Trust Infrastructure, with the following properties: 1. The Internet today as a network of connectivity will be transformed into a network of trust, on which any two strangers on earth can trust each other fully and instantly. This mutual trust is not based on moral evaluation of the other party, but rather on the powerful \u201ctrust machine technology\u201d which makes any violation of rules practically impossible. 2. All data from all individuals and institutions on earth are shared, as if in one huge single database. These data can be used in specific ways as authorized by the data owners. These authorizations will specify what computation is allowed, and to whom the results can be given. Beyond such authorized use, all data are kept in full privacy. 3. All computers in the world owned by different individuals and institutions are connected in such a way that they together function like a huge single computer, available for use by everyone. Again, this is done with full protection of privacy for all parties. 4. The organization of human society will be changed fundamentally. Traditionally, the primary function of most human organizations is to provide trust, namely, to act as a TTP. But this function will no longer be needed when the Global Trust Infrastructure becomes widely available. The implication is: most human organizations as we know today will disappear. 5. In particular, most of the business models we know today will disappear. Business models which are based on various forms of the monopoly of resources, such as data, information, special knowledge, and other privileges will gradually lose their overwhelming dominance. The whole economical structure will take a new form in which most values are given to those activities of actual products and services. On the other hand, sales as a profession, advertisement as an industry (which makes up about 2% of GDP today), may gradually disappear. In fact, the future is already happening now. The large-scale experimentation of DeFi since 2020 may eventually lead to the disappearance of all traditional financial institutions and the whole industry. This change will not stop with finance but will expand to the whole economy and the whole society in every aspect. This was what happened with the Internet in the past 25 years. I believe the trust machine technology, which includes blockchain in its initial form, is a much more disruptive technology than the Internet, with more profound consequences to human society. As regards research, we are building a new research team at Peking University. The area of research will be around the keywords like Cyberspace, Trust, Trust Machine, and new business models based on the new technology. I will touch upon a few points. 1. What is Cyberspace? We all vaguely know what cyberspace is. However, it is not yet a precisely defined scientific concept. The time may have come that we gain a more formal understanding of it. The first intuition of space comes from the 3-dimensional physical space, which can be extended to the 4-dimensional spacetimes. To describe the position of saying an airplane, you go to 5-dimensional space. To describe extended objects such as electromagnetic fields or the shape of an elastic body, you use function spaces which have infinite dimensions. All these types of spaces have the concept of continuity and various way of measurement in terms of distance, length, areas, and so on. In mathematics, another important type of space arises from the study of algebraic geometry and number theory, in which there can be found another type of continuity, as well as the various concepts of intersection between geometric configurations. But what is cyberspace? From a simplistic view, you can think of it as a collection of computer systems connected by a certain communication network in which many parties can interact with each other. But this description hardly indicates its highly non-trivial complexity. The real wonder of cyberspace emerges only with the deep study of cryptography, as roughly described in what we earlier described as Trust 1.0\u20134.0. These are all based on some very profound mathematical principle, the existence of one-way function, which implies the famous conjecture P\u2260NP. So, we see that cyberspace, namely the space of information, is really a quite strange animal. It is starkly different from any mathematical space we have encountered before. Its most important properties are derived from various non-invertibility of computation. To put it more quantitatively, it is about some asymmetry property of the computational process, measured by computational complexity. The times lock puzzle which later developed into the idea of verifiable delay function (VDF) shows this quantitative aspect more clearly. Another question is, is cyberspace a purely discrete object? So far, the science of cryptography has mostly been approached by a discrete view. However, much important information contained in the form of voice, image and video are inherently more of continuous objects, which cannot be fully modeled by a discrete view. So, is there a certain mathematical formulation of the concept of cyberspace, which can capture many of its important features, and serve as a foundation for future study? 2. Two Wings of Trust in Duality We have informally discussed trust and its two aspects: 1) proper behavior enforcement; 2) privacy. They set limits on what you can do, and what you can see respectively. This reminds us of an important phenomenon in control theory, the duality between observability and controllability. This duality principle was first discovered in linear control theory, mathematically expressed by matrix transposition. Interestingly, this duality is also found in non-linear control theory based on differential equations, and in automata theory. So, is there a similar duality in the context of cryptography? We have described blockchain as a half trust machine in the sense that it only limits what you do, but not what you see. In the general theory of MPC, we encounter another type of \u201chalf trust machine\u201d which is secure only under \u201csemi-honest\u201d assumption, namely that each party will voluntarily do only what they are supposed to do (but may try their best to know what they are not supposed to know). These two types of \u201chalf trust machines\u201d are apparently in some kind of duality. Interestingly, in both cases, the weakness can be fixed by zero-knowledge proof. transparent blockchain + ZKP \u2192 blockchain of privacy semi-honest secure MPC + ZKP \u2192 malicious secure MPC Figure 14: How ZKP Relationship to Privacy-Preserving Computation and Malicious Secure MPC We all know the wonder of the duality principle in mathematics. Starting with the duality between points and lines discovered in the early days of projective geometry, and later duality in the topology of manifold discovered by Poincare. Fourier transform is a kind of duality. There is also duality in optimization theory, linear programming, and so on. We have also heard about the duality which connects five different string theories into one M-theory. So, regarding the apparent duality we observed between the two aspects of trust, is it the result of some precise mathematical principle? Is there some kind of duality theory in cyberspace? 3. Trust Machine Construction The quick rise of blockchain since 2009 has captured the eyes of the world. However, I personally feel that blockchain is but the \u201ctoy car\u201d version of the much wider framework of Trust Machine Technology, which will be the real future. From the point of view of business application (or more general social application), the real need is a trust machine, of which blockchain is a remote approximation. Blockchain is something you can play with immediately for quick results. But from a research point of view, you need to look a bit more ahead and probe further into the fundamentals. Nowadays, there is a proliferation of experiments in this field, with vanilla blockchain, blockchain + ZKP, blockchain + storage, blockchain + data, blockchain +MPC, layer 2 solutions, cross-chain solutions, blockchain + TEE, and so on. All these are attempts to construct various forms of trust machine, using blockchain as a handy component. But there could be a different approach to the problem. The all-powerful trust machine from MPC has already solved nearly all problems in theory. The next step is to look for concrete constructions which strike a reasonable balance among functionality, efficiency, security, and other practical factors. For this purpose, it seems necessary to develop more precise and quantitative measures to these different factors, so that we can better evaluate the merits of any specific construction. We can also ask whether a particular construction is optimal under certain conditions. Given the above general view, we might also ask, what is blockchain as a trust machine? What is its place in trust machine construction in general? Should it occupy a central position, and if so, why? If not so, what are the other important tools? We see formal modeling of blockchain given in a 2015 paper on Hawk, which has such flavor. Another very important question is the composition of trust machines. As discussed earlier, all separate trust machines constructed for a certain domain application in the world should eventually merge into one Global Trust Infrastructure. Is this technically viable? How should it be done? Experiments on cross-chain solutions are trying to address this issue from an engineering point of view. However, it seems unlikely that this very complex problem can find its proper solution by such a trial and error approach alone. Some true innovations based on advanced cryptography seem needed. 4. New Business Models Trust machine in its ideal capacity (a highly efficient Global Trust Infrastructure) will render most of the traditional business model obsolete. However, present-day technology is not quite there yet. So, we expect a gradual process of evolution, with continuous technical and business innovation going hand in hand. Bitcoin has been a most successful case of such a double innovation. Note that the technology is highly original, yet of very low capacity. So, one needs to dig into various vertical domains and identify the right kind of use cases. Such cases should have two characteristics: 1) business-wise, it should be disruptive and highly impactful to its relevant domain; 2) technically, it should be within the capacity of today\u2019s technical innovation. Question 9 Xinyu Tian: In your presentation at the World Blockchain Congress 2021 in Hangzhou, you mentioned that the Internet Computer launched by DFINITY is one of the major breakthroughs in the mainstream of blockchain innovation in the past 10 years. How do you think the Internet Computer can possibly empower your research? What support do you need to innovate with the Internet Computer? What technical questions may you have for the DFINITY engineers? Are you interested in a collaboration between DFINITY and your research center? Figure 15: DFINITY Prof. Kevin Mo: In our conversation today, what I consider the most important is the formation of a Global Trust Infrastructure, serving as the foundation of the whole future cyber economy and cyber social governance. Among all the blockchain projects I have come to know, DFINITY\u2019s vision of the Internet Computer seems to come the closest to that idea of infrastructure. So, personally, I really like it very much and wish for its success. In principle, any blockchain with smart contract capacity, such as Ethereum, Algorand, and so on, has the flavor of infrastructure, a kind of open operating system on the Internet. But to really function as such, major technical progress is still needed. A practically useful infrastructure must have unlimited scalability in computation, communication, and storage capacity, and the ability to protect the privacy of both data and codes when required. It\u2019s like building a decentralized operating system on Internet, which is obviously a big and difficult job. It\u2019s wonderful to see DFINITY is making great progress in this general direction. At this point, I don\u2019t know enough details about the actual technology of DFINITY yet. So, I am not able to make a very technical assessment. Hope I will be able to learn more about it in some future time and to appreciate its achievements more intimately. I am certainly interested in the possible collaboration between DFINITY and our center. One possibility is to take Internet Computer as a ready framework for experimentation, to see how it may be used to foster highly innovative business models in some vertical domains. I have read about DFINITY\u2019s ideas on decentralized TikTok, and even decentralized Android, which is all very inspiring. I believe there are many such possibilities waiting for our exploration. Another possible contact point is our interest in the study of trust machine construction as discussed earlier. DFINITY itself is a great case of such construction. DFINITY working with other chains provide great cases for trust machine compositions. I personally feel that this is a vast fertile land for technical innovation. I would be quite glad to be engaged in some joint exploration in these directions. Concluding Remarks Prof. Luyao Zhang: Thank you so much, Prof. Kevin Mo for your very insightful discussion today, and we will also contact DFINITY engineers for your questions like what is the technical thing that they think they can fulfill trust infrastructure for Web 3.0, and we will also get back to you about the answers of how we can develop future applications as students, scholars, and professors on this type of infrastructures. Prof. Kevin Mo: Thank you, Professor Zhang, for arranging this interview, and thanks to your team for all the preparation work. I am thrilled to have had this great discussion!

Zero-knowledge proof In cryptography , a zero-knowledge proof or zero-knowledge protocol is a method by which one party (the prover) can prove to another party (the verifier) that they know a value x, conveying no information apart from the fact that they know the value x. The essence of zero-knowledge proof is that it is trivial to prove that one possesses knowledge of certain information by simply revealing it; the challenge is to prove such possession without revealing the information itself or any additional information. Wikipedia 5. Homomorphic encryption Homomorphic encryption is encryption that permits users to perform computations on its encrypted data without first decrypting it. These resulting computations are left in an encrypted form which, when decrypted, resulting in an identical output to that produced had the operations been performed on the unencrypted data. Homomorphic encryption can be used for privacy-preserving outsourced storage and computation. This allows data to be encrypted and out-sourced to commercial cloud environments for processing, all while encrypted. Wikipedia 6. Secure multi-party computation Secure multi-party computation (also known as secure computation, multi-party computation (MPC), or privacy-preserving computation) is a subfield of cryptography with the goal of creating methods for parties to jointly compute a function over their inputs while keeping those inputs private. Unlike traditional cryptographic tasks, where cryptography ensures security and integrity of communication or storage and the adversary is outside the system of participants (an eavesdropper on the sender and receiver), the cryptography in this model protects participants\u2019 privacy from each other. Wikipedia 7. Cyberspace Cyberspace is a concept describing a widespread interconnected digital technology. It refers to the online world as a world \u2018apart\u2019, as distinct from everyday reality. The term is described as the domain of the global technology environment, commonly defined as standing for the global network of interdependent information technology infrastructures, telecommunications networks, and computer processing systems.

PKI/HTTPS technology PKI: A public key infrastructure (PKI) is a set of roles, policies, hardware, software, and procedures needed to create, manage, distribute, use, store and revoke digital certificates and manage public-key encryption . The purpose of a PKI is to facilitate the secure electronic transfer of information for a range of network activities, such as e-commerce, internet banking, and confidential email. It is required for activities where simple passwords are an inadequate authentication method and the more rigorous proof is required to confirm the identity of the parties involved in the communication and to validate the information being transferred. HTTPS: Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) extends the Hypertext Transfer Protoco l (HTTP). It is used for secure communication over a computer network and is widely used on the Internet. In HTTPS, the communication protocol is encrypted using Transport Layer Securit y (TLS) or, formerly, Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). The protocol is therefore also referred to as HTTP over TLS, or HTTP over SSL. Wikipedia , Wikipedia 9. Julius Caesar Julius Caesar was a renowned general, politician, and scholar in ancient Rome who conquered the vast region of Gaul and helped initiate the end of the Roman Republic when he became dictator of the Roman Empire. Despite his brilliant military prowess, his political skills, and his popularity with Rome\u2019s lower- and middle-class, his rule was cut short when opponents \u2014 threatened by his rising power \u2014 brutally assassinated him. Wikipedia 10. SSL/TLS Transport Layer Security (TLS), the successor of the now-deprecated Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), is a cryptographic protocol designed to provide communications security over a computer network. The protocol is widely used in applications such as email, instant messaging, and voice over IP, but its use as the Security layer in HTTPS remains the most publicly visible. Wikipedia 11. Trusted third party (TTP) In cryptography, a trusted third party (TTP) is an entity that facilitates interactions between two parties who both trust the third party; the Third Party reviews all critical transaction communications between the parties, based on the ease of creating fraudulent digital content. In TTP models, the relying parties use this trust to secure their own interactions. TTPs are common in any number of commercial transactions and in cryptographic digital transactions as well as cryptographic protocols. For example, a certificate authority (CA) would issue a digital certificate to one of the two parties in the next example. The CA then becomes the Trusted-Third-Party to that certificate\u2019s issuance. Likewise, transactions that need third-party recordation would also need a third-party repository service of some kind or another. Wikipedia 12. John 20:29 John 20:29 is the twenty-ninth verse of the twentieth chapter of the Gospel of John in the New Testament. It records Jesus\u2019 reappearance to the disciples, including Thomas, eight days after his resurrection. Wikipedia 13. Proof-of-Work (PoW) Proof-of-Work (PoW) describes a system that requires a not-insignificant but feasible amount of effort in order to deter frivolous or malicious uses of computing power, such as sending spam emails or launching a denial of service attacks. Investopedia 14. Proof-of-Stake (PoS) The Proof of Stake (PoS) concept states that a person can mine or validate block transactions according to how many coins they hold. This means that the more coins owned by a miner, the more mining power they have. Investopedia 15. Proof-of-storage (PoS) Proof-of-storage (PoS) is a cryptographic protocol used primarily to verify the integrity of a remote file. This is done by sending an encoded copy of the data to a server and then executing a challenge-response protocol to check the data\u2019s integrity. This protocol is normally used when considering the efficiency of a cloud storage server. Golden 16. TEE A trusted execution environment (TEE) is a secure area of the main processor . It guarantees code and data loaded inside to be protected regarding confidentiality and integrity. A TEE as an isolated execution environment provides security features such as isolated execution, the integrity of applications executing with the TEE, along confidentiality of their assets. In general terms, the TEE offers an execution space that provides a higher level of security for trusted applications running on the device than a rich operating system (OS) and more functionality than a \u2018secure element\u2019 (SE).

Humanity as a species has been living in the physical world throughout its long evolution history tracing back to the time when life was born on earth. Great amounts of accumulated experiences and knowledge gradually developed into systematic scientific theories such as Newtonian mechanics [1], Einstein\u2019s relativity [2], quantum physics [3], and so on, which attempted to capture the natural laws of the physical world. The understanding of these natural laws made it possible for human beings to observe and manipulate elements of the physical world, namely various forms of matter and energy, with great precision and accuracy. This became the foundation of technological developments such as the invention of automobiles, airplanes, satellites, semiconductors, lasers, GPS, and so on, which provided much comfort and convenience to humans living in the physical world. Since the inception of business Internet in 1994 ( Charmonman et al, 1994 ), humanity has started a process of rapid migration from the physical world to this newly created cyber world, which has been growing every day, and becoming more and more like our second home. This cyber world is similar to the physical world in the sense that both are kind of \u201cplaces\u201d where we can \u201clive in\u201d, namely, to conduct various activities, to interact with each other, and to enjoy. On the other hand, the cyber world is also very different from the physical world, with its own peculiar properties. It has its own natural laws, and therefore must have its own sciences and corresponding technologies. What are they? My personal answer is: the so-called \u201cprivacy-preserving computation\u201d, in its theoretical aspect, namely the science of advanced cryptography, is nothing but the science of the cyber world. It began with Diffie and Hellman\u2019s groundbreaking paper in 1976 , and now includes things like zero-knowledge proofs [5], homomorphic encryption [6], secure multi-party computation [7], and so on. It is the result of many important scientific discoveries (comparable to Einstein\u2019s discovery of relativity) made in the past 45 years or so, capturing fundamental natural laws of cyberspace [4]. These natural laws are quite subtle and intricate, often counterintuitive, in the sense that many seemingly impossible things are shown to be possible. They are more abstract than Newton\u2019s gravity, not so easy to grasp without some mathematical thinking. Figure 2: Zero-Knowledge Proofs Along with the scientific exploration, technological development of the cyber world takes form around 1995 when SSL/TLS was developed in Netscape Navigator. This PKI/HTTPS technology [8] was the first attempt to bring some order to the new cyber world, which made e-commerce possible. But the true milestone was the invention of the blockchain ( Nakamoto, 2009 ), which for the first time demonstrated the possibility of constructing a self-governing \u201ccivilized cybercity\u201d, which seems entirely independent of the physical world. We summarize the above in the following formulas: privacy-preserving computation = science of cyberspace blockchain = technology of cyberspace (in today\u2019s form) Figure 3: Visualization of Science and Technology of Cyberspace","title":"Prof. Kevin Mo:"},{"location":"articles/AMA/AConversationonCryptographyTrustMachineandCyberPlanetConstruction/#question-2","text":"","title":"Question 2"},{"location":"articles/AMA/AConversationonCryptographyTrustMachineandCyberPlanetConstruction/#tianyu-wu","text":"We all know the importance of the Internet and cyberspace as you put it. But this really involves the whole field of \u201ccomputer science\u201d, right? Why do you give special importance to privacy-preserving computation and blockchain technology?","title":"Tianyu Wu:"},{"location":"articles/AMA/AConversationonCryptographyTrustMachineandCyberPlanetConstruction/#prof-kevin-mo_2","text":"Yes, this brings us to the central point of the matter, which is TRUST construction. In my view, cyberspace today as a whole is still like the planet Mars, not quite ready for human habitation. Great ecological transformation is needed to make it a truly livable planet. The central factor of this transformation is the formation of an overall ground of TRUST, upon which other social and economic constructions can be built. The blockchain revolution that started in 2009 was a major breakthrough in this direction. But much more is still needed. In the physical world, civilized human living requires stable supplies of food, shelter, clothing, and basic social structure such as families, tribes, or more advanced forms of social governance, which provides the basic sense of security. In the case of cyberspace, a similar sense of security is also needed, so that its inhabitants can interact with each other in trust and confidence. Trust in cyberspace is as basic as food and shelter in the physical world. To come back to your question, my answer can be summarized as follow: privacy-preserving computation = science of trust blockchain = technology of trust (in today\u2019s form) Figure 4: Visualization of Science and Technology of Trust We add the qualification \u201cin today\u2019s form\u201d because there is the feeling that blockchain technology is likely to evolve into some much more sophisticated form in the future and may not be called \u201cblockchain\u201d anymore. Figure 5: Cybertrust Now, what do we mean by trust? Roughly speaking, in a multiparty cooperative mechanism, trust means the confidence that everything will happen only within pre-defined rules. More precisely, every party can \u201cdo things\u201d and \u201cknow things\u201d only within those rules. To get a more concrete idea, just imagine four persons playing a game of bridge. A set of rules specifies what each party can do and can know. So, we have the following formula: Trust = Proper Behavior Enforcement + Privacy Figure 6: Trust which captures the two fundamental aspects of trust. In this view, we realize that the term privacy-preserving computation is partial in its meaning. A more accurate terminology should be: Trust Computation = Theory of Advanced Cryptography Trust Engineering = Blockchain (and Its Future Variants) Figure 7: Trust Computation and Trust Engineering","title":"Prof. Kevin Mo:"},{"location":"articles/AMA/AConversationonCryptographyTrustMachineandCyberPlanetConstruction/#question-3","text":"","title":"Question 3"},{"location":"articles/AMA/AConversationonCryptographyTrustMachineandCyberPlanetConstruction/#xinyu-tian","text":"From your description above, you seem to imply that the construction of trust in cyberspace is not a small task, and we are still in the beginning stage of this work. If this is the case, could you elaborate further, so that we get a more concrete idea of what you mean by trust construction, and also an overall picture of what lies in the future?","title":"Xinyu Tian:"},{"location":"articles/AMA/AConversationonCryptographyTrustMachineandCyberPlanetConstruction/#prof-kevin-mo_3","text":"Yes, I do think trust construction in cyberspace is essentially the building of entirely new infrastructure. In terms of the time period, it would be reasonable to think on a scale of say 30\u201350 years. We can compare it with the building of the Internet, which is essentially an infrastructure of connectivity. It has been going on for nearly 30 years by now, and we cannot quite say it has reached its full maturity. But as we will see more clearly along with our discussion, \u201ctrust\u201d is something much more complex and sophisticated than \u201cconnectivity\u201d. So we cannot expect it to be done very quickly. Now, let\u2019s try to understand the matter from a historic perspective and see how the science of cryptography helps to build step by step an increasingly more powerful trust infrastructure for human society. For the sake of explanation, I will divide it into four development stages. Trust 1.0: Symmetric Cryptography This goes back to the time of Julius Caesar [9] (or even earlier) and reached a high degree of maturity in the 1970s when the Data Encryption Standard (DES) was published. It was a technology of secure communication that represented the first step of trust construction for human interaction in the \u201cinformation space\u201d. There was no cyberspace as we understand today, but you can also think there was a kind of cyberspace in its infancy. One thing to realize is that it has taken humanity 2000 years to reach this stage. Even if we count from the beginning of the 20th century, it has still taken decades of time to mature the technology. In this case, maturity means, first of all, that the encryption is practically unbreakable in a strong enough sense. Figure 8: Symmetric Cryptography Trust 2.0: Public-Key Cryptography, PKI/HTTPS Public-key cryptography was discovered around 1976 ( Diffie and Hellman, 1976 ), which opened entirely new possibilities. 20 years later, around 1995, it was used in the design of SSL/TLS[10] in the HTTPS protocol. Together with the hierarchy of PKI (public-key infrastructure), a certain trust system was established, so that general e-commerce became possible. Individuals and institutions were confident enough to input their private information on a web page for business transactions. Figure 9: Public-Key Cryptography Nowadays, HTTPS and e-commerce have become so commonplace, so we forgot that this had been a great technical achievement, which would not be possible without its scientific foundation (public-key cryptography). This was the first step of bringing trust to cyberspace. But this approach still depends heavily on the existing trust system of the physical world. It also followed the traditional logic of relying on some third-party authorities. Trust 3.0: Nakamoto\u2019s Blockchain, Half Trust Machine Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s Bitcoin in 2009 brought an entirely new conception of trust to human society. It effectively constructed an intrinsic trust system within cyberspace itself, with almost no reference to the physical world. Cooperative parties can deal with each other without know the other party\u2019s physical identity or other physical attributes and conditions. Blockchain is then also called a TRUST MACHINE. What exactly is a trust machine? Nakamoto\u2019s original vision is clear. The main purpose is to be free of the traditional reliance on \u201ctrust third party\u201d (TTP) [11]. Through a distributed protocol based on cryptography (plus some economic principles), one effectively creates a \u201cvirtual TTP\u201d which functions almost like a real TTP. This is to say, Bitcoin functions almost like a real bank, without having such a bank. This is the meaning of the trust machine. A trusted machine is nothing but a set of distributed computer programs that collectively function almost like a TTP, without actually having that TTP. But things are not so simple yet. Does Bitcoin truly function as a real bank? The answer is \u201cnot quite\u201d, and there is some vital difference. A real bank maintains strict privacy for its customers, while Bitcoin simply doesn\u2019t have that ability. All accounting information of Bitcoin is open to the public. Nakamoto was clearly aware of this weakness and suggested a few remedies in the latter part of his original 2008 paper, which was not a real solution at all. But Bitcoin has been functioning fine so far despite this weakness. This is largely because the world of Bitcoin now operates quite independently from the physical world, so that the privacy problem can be tolerated. But if you want to use blockchain in real-world business applications, this will not work anymore. Real business data is almost always highly confidential. The above analysis is leading to an important conclusion. Nakamoto\u2019s blockchain is not yet a \u201ctrust machine\u201d, so we call it a \u201chalf trust machine\u201d. As such, it is incapable of delivering most of its promises to society under the vague idea of a \u201ctrust machine\u201d. You might ask, who made those promises? Maybe nobody in particular, but there was just a huge collectively created misunderstanding. To put this issue in focus, let\u2019s just look at one business use case: to build a fully decentralized stock exchange which can replace NYSE and NASDAQ, in which quotations from traders are strictly confidential information. Careful examination of this case should convince you that Nakamoto\u2019s blockchain is incapable of this task. More generally speaking, Nakamoto\u2019s blockchain is mostly unusable for real business applications. Is there a solution to the above problem? To answer this question is really the central theme of our conversation. Figure 10: Bitcoin Trust 4.0: Trust Computation, Full Trust Machine Seeing the inadequacy of blockchain as a \u201chalf trust machine\u201d, is there such a thing in the world that can be called a \u201cfull trust machine\u201d? One may be surprised to learn that such a trust machine has been discovered long ago before blockchain. The prototype of which was given in Shamir, Rivest, and Adleman\u2019s 1979 paper: Mental Poker , (the same authors discovered the famous RSA algorithm in 1978). The paper raised a very strange question: Can two potentially dishonest players play a fair game of poker using no cards (e.g. over the phone)? Hearing such a question, almost everybody should answer \u201cimpossible\u201d. But contrary to your expectation, the paper provided a positive solution. Think about this more carefully. You may realize how peculiar and how amazing this is. Figure 11: Trust Machine I personally regard this as a great scientific discovery of information science. Using today\u2019s concepts, this may be thought of as a fundamental discovery about cyberspace, comparable to Newton\u2019s discovery of gravity about the physical world. This was 30 years ahead of blockchain, and from scientific point of view, a far superior achievement than blockchain. It accomplished something that the blockchain is incapable of, namely the formation of mutual trust in full privacy. To be more precise, it means the construction of a certain mathematical communication procedure between two persons, so that they can engage in a certain interactive game (such as poker), in which each party cannot know anything about what happens in the other party (unless allowed by the rules), and yet cheating is not possible. Because thou hast seen me, thou hast believed: blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have believed. John 20:29 [12] . The above initial discovery was studied further by Andrew Yao (1982) with the famous millionaire\u2019s problem, which gave birth to a new branch of cryptography, secure multiparty computation (MPC). In its most general formulation, the problem MPC intends to solve is exactly the construction of a \u201cfull trust machine\u201d, namely an interactive protocol which functions \u201cfully\u201d as a trusted third party (TTP). During the 1980s, the above goal had been fully achieved under very general assumptions (such as the number of adversaries is less than \u00bd, or less than 1/3, and so on). Figure 12: Secure Multi-Party Computation After all the above explanation, let\u2019s jump to a general statement: the vague vision of blockchain as trust machine, as entertained by many people in the society, the business community, or even many blockchain professionals, cannot be realized by blockchain alone. But it can be realized through advanced cryptography (alone or in combination with blockchain), which includes sophisticated schemes such as zero knowledge proofs, homomorphic encryption, secure multiparty computation, and so on. This constitutes the true promised land of trust construction in cyberspace.","title":"Prof. Kevin Mo:"},{"location":"articles/AMA/AConversationonCryptographyTrustMachineandCyberPlanetConstruction/#question-4","text":"","title":"Question 4"},{"location":"articles/AMA/AConversationonCryptographyTrustMachineandCyberPlanetConstruction/#prof-luyao-zhang_2","text":"You distinguished \u201chalf trust machine\u201d from \u201cfull trust machine\u201d. Can you go further into the exact difference between the two?","title":"Prof. Luyao Zhang:"},{"location":"articles/AMA/AConversationonCryptographyTrustMachineandCyberPlanetConstruction/#prof-kevin-mo_4","text":"OK, let\u2019s go into the mental poker problem in a little more detail. Consider two poker players, A in San Francisco, B in New York, and they want to play a game on phone. How would they do that? The easiest solution is to find a third person C, whom both A and B trustfully. With the help of C, A, and B can play the game easily. Now, what do we mean by trusting C? It includes two aspects: 1) C must ensure both players follow the rules of the game; 2) C must not reveal any more information to each party than prescribed by the rule of the game. Now, the whole point of the \u201cmental poker problem\u201d is to realize the above function of C through a telephone conversation between A and B, without having the actual person (or a machine) C. In other words, one must design such a special form of conversation (called a protocol) such that it emulates C\u2019s job in both aspects: 1) rule enforcement; 2) information hiding (privacy). Blockchain can emulate the first aspect, but not the second. Blockchain can emulate chess (which contains no private information), but not poker. Let\u2019s summarize our analysis in the following formulas: half trust machine = phone call which can emulate chess game full trust machine = phone call which can emulate poker game What\u2019s the implication of this to business? Now, consider any real-world multiparty business cooperation, would it be more like a chess game or a poker game? We have talked about the case of a fully decentralized stock exchange, which trades not a cryptocurrency, but real stocks. We can also think of the auction market, restate agency business, and so on. You can analyze dozens of business use cases, and come to realize that almost all valuable cases are more like poker rather than chess, namely that privacy is an absolute requirement. Conclusion: blockchain without advanced cryptography is only a \u201chalf trust machine\u201d which has only limited value in real-world business applications. The future lies in the construction of a \u201cfull trust machine\u201d through advanced cryptography (possibly in combination with blockchain).","title":"Prof. Kevin Mo:"},{"location":"articles/AMA/AConversationonCryptographyTrustMachineandCyberPlanetConstruction/#question-5","text":"","title":"Question 5"},{"location":"articles/AMA/AConversationonCryptographyTrustMachineandCyberPlanetConstruction/#tianyu-wu_1","text":"What you said seems to make sense. But if as you said, a much more advanced and powerful theory/technology you named \u201ctrust 4.0\u201d already existed in the 1980s, then why is there still a place for blockchain which came much later in time?","title":"Tianyu Wu:"},{"location":"articles/AMA/AConversationonCryptographyTrustMachineandCyberPlanetConstruction/#prof-kevin-mo_5","text":"Good question. So far, we have emphasized the vital limitation of blockchain as a \u201chalf trust machine\u201d. But to gain a full picture of the situation, we need also to understand a few other important points. Point 1: General Purpose \u201cFull Trust Machine\u201d is Not Practical Today because of High Cost Full trust machine in its most general form has been accomplished in the 1980s in MPC theory. However, the computation/communication cost required is very high. Great improvements have been made during the past 15 years or so. But it\u2019s still quite far from being practical. A full trust machine could also be constructed using fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) schemes (the first such scheme was constructed by Craig Gentry\u2019s Stanford thesis in 2009, which had been a great breakthrough in cryptography). These schemes allow arbitrary computation to be performed on encrypted data without decryption. But it also suffers a similar performance cost problem. Using the best-optimized scheme today, FHE\u2019s computation cost is still about 1,000\u201310,000 times of ordinary computation. Figure 13: Fully Homomorphic Encryption Trust Machine is a truly revolutionary concept that can change the underlying foundation of human society, including business as well as social governance in general. However, its full realization does incur such a high cost that it\u2019s not practical available yet. In contrast, blockchain as a half trust machine, has the advantage of being immediately available. Acting as a kind of \u201ctoy car\u201d technology, it allows the society at large to play with it, and get familiar with many of the new concepts involved. Bitcoin, Ethereum, DeFi, NFT, GameFi, Metaverse are among such experimentations that have been conducted at scale, without waiting for the true technology of \u201cfull trust machine\u201d. Point 2: Why Blockchain as a \u201cToy Car\u201d Solution Is Still So Successful? The phenomenal success of blockchain since 2009 testify to the ingenuity of its design. The idea of replacing TTP with a distributed protocol is expressly stated in Nakamoto\u2019s paper. But unlike MPC theory which tackled the problem in its full generality, Bitcoin focused only on one simple case: electronic cash payment system, which simplifies the problem greatly. Let\u2019s look into a number of factors which contributed to its success. 1) By focusing on the payment system, it needs to deal only with simple mathematics of addition and subtraction mostly. This made the system very light. 2) Nakamoto left the problem of privacy unsolved. Bitcoin (and other cryptocurrencies) practically got away with this problem by the fact that users\u2019 crypto identities (their public keys and private keys) are not linked to their physical identity. 3) Blockchain introduced an economical (or game-theoretical) principle into the protocol. So, its security depends not only on cryptography, but also on the economic interests of the participants. In other words, to attack the system may not be in their best business interests. This is indeed a new contribution made by blockchain design. 4) It created and issued new \u201ccurrency\u201d out of nothing, which practically caused a continuous flow of transition of wealth from society in general to the crypto community. It may sound a bit like robbery, but we will not get into moral issues here. In any case, it provides a powerful channel of financing to the community so that continuous innovation, development, and system maintenance are well supported. All these contributed to the quick rise of blockchain. The vital issue of privacy has largely been evaded, but not resolved. It will prevent blockchain from going very far into real-world business applications.","title":"Prof. Kevin Mo:"},{"location":"articles/AMA/AConversationonCryptographyTrustMachineandCyberPlanetConstruction/#question-6","text":"","title":"Question 6"},{"location":"articles/AMA/AConversationonCryptographyTrustMachineandCyberPlanetConstruction/#xinyu-tian_1","text":"You have just described two cases: on the one hand is the general-purpose full trust machine, which is good in theory but impractical due to the high cost. On the other hand, is blockchain as a half trust machine that cannot maintain privacy, and therefore not good enough for business use. So, what is the way out?","title":"Xinyu Tian:"},{"location":"articles/AMA/AConversationonCryptographyTrustMachineandCyberPlanetConstruction/#prof-kevin-mo_6","text":"Interestingly, besides the two extreme cases, there seems to be a vast promised land in between. One particularly interesting approach is the combination of blockchain with zero-knowledge proofs. To appreciate the value of this approach, let\u2019s look into another vital defect of the original blockchain design: the extreme inefficiency of the system due to the requirement that every miner must repeat all the work of bookkeeping. As a result, blockchain\u2019s computation and storage capacities are extremely limited. These fundamental difficulties are also expressed as Vitalik\u2019s blockchain trilemma among decentralization, security, and scalability. As it turned out, Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) proves to be a powerful tool to solve these problems. Simply put, both the privacy problem and the efficiency problem. Historically speaking, Nakamoto\u2019s Bitcoin paper in 2008 was preceded by a series of sophisticated research in e-cash, in which the ideas of using ZKP had been explored extensively. Bitcoin did not use any of it, but the ideas were around in the circle. An important development was the appearance of the Pinocchio protocol in 2013, which for the first time brought the performance of general-purpose ZKP to a practical level. This was then implemented in Zcash and launched in 2016, which demonstrated the power of ZKP in facilitating mutual trust in full privacy. After Zcash, some other different cases were developed, each demonstrating the power of ZKP from a different angle. Together they seem to indicate a very promising direction for the near future. The following are some of the interesting cases: 1. The transition from Proof-of-Work (PoW) [13] to Proof-of-Stake [14] through the use of Verifiable Random Function (VRF) [15] which has in it the element of ZKP, and we see this in the research of Algorand , Ouroboros , DFINITY and Dusk Network . 2. Ethereum scalability through zk-rollup , which expands the computation and storage capacity of the main chain by delegating those tasks to off-chain resources, while ensuring the correctness of those computations through ZKP. 3. Dusk Network expands on Zcash and aims to support real-world security trading (going outside the crypto world), in which privacy is a requirement, not an option. 4. FileCoin uses Verifiable Delay Functions (VDF) ( Boneh et al, 2019 ) and Proof-of-Storage (PoS) [16]. We see ZKP in the role of creating trust among different parties so that they can work together in coordination to form a single larger system. 5. Mina uses a sophisticated form of ZKP called \u201crecursive proof\u201d ( Bowe et al, 2019 ) to achieve something quite amazing. It manages to compress the whole blockchain into the size of 22k, so that even a very light node (say an old mobile phone) can participate in the process of verification. This technology may be used to prevent the situation as in for example Bitcoin where power got more and more concentrated in a small number of mining pools. 6. zkEVM represents a more recent effort to provide a comprehensive solution in this general direction. Some time is still needed for us to see how successful it may be. In summary, this approach aims to develop a blockchain system which can fully satisfy the two major demands of real-world business applications: 1) absolute privacy; 2) reasonable level of performance. Viewing as a trust machine, it lies in the middle ground between the two extreme cases as you asked.","title":"Prof. Kevin Mo:"},{"location":"articles/AMA/AConversationonCryptographyTrustMachineandCyberPlanetConstruction/#question-7","text":"","title":"Question 7"},{"location":"articles/AMA/AConversationonCryptographyTrustMachineandCyberPlanetConstruction/#prof-luyao-zhang_3","text":"It\u2019s exciting to hear about all the progress with this approach of combining blockchain with ZKP.

However, this ideal technology exists only in theory today. Even with the best-optimized algorithms, the best available commercial hardware, and the best attainable network speed, its implementation would still be too slow. So, this technology is not quite ready yet for large-scale adoption by the industry. The blockchain + ZKP approach is different. It is fast enough to be usable now. Naturally, it cannot be \u201cgeneral purpose\u201d. It can only handle specific class of multiparty computations. So, we may call it special purpose \u201cfull trust machine\u201d. It is \u201cfull\u201d in the sense of fulfilling both demands of trust, namely: 1) proper behavior enforcement; 2) privacy. Regarding the \u201cspecial purpose\u201d aspect, how special exactly? This is something that needs to be clarified by further research. One point to be noted is, this approach seems to work well only with tasks which do not require complex computations with a lot of data mixing among different parties. But fortunately, it does cover a very wide range of valuable business applications. One can reasonably expect the gradual realization of its enormous potential in the next 20\u201330 years. What about complex computations with a lot of data mixing among different parties? Again, useful computational tasks are usually not so \u201cgeneric\u201d. To the specific class of computations, specific optimization may be found. If not, then in principle, it may really require general-purpose MPC schemes, or full homomorphic encryption schemes, which are very costly. An alternative to that is the hardware solutions based on TEE [17]. It is fast enough, but then you will need to trust the hardware vendors for security. Another approach to the privacy problem is through access control. This approach is used extensively by the so-called permissioned blockchain. But it this approach appears to have a fundamental conceptual weakness. By keeping certain data private from a certain party, also renders the data totally unusable by that party. This is not the kind of privacy we really want, because it defeats the very purpose of a trust machine. The whole point of a trust machine is to be able to use those data without seeing them. This leads us to the following view: blockchain schemes heavily based on access control seem to have deviated from the vision of the trust machine fundamentally. This deviation naturally carries over to the business application level. The power of blockchain as a disruptive technology may be lost to a very large degree. Some people may think otherwise on this point, but let time tell it.","title":"Prof. Kevin Mo:"},{"location":"articles/AMA/AConversationonCryptographyTrustMachineandCyberPlanetConstruction/#question-8","text":"","title":"Question 8"},{"location":"articles/AMA/AConversationonCryptographyTrustMachineandCyberPlanetConstruction/#tianyu-wu_2","text":"Can you briefly envision the future society in Cyberspace by highlighting some of your research interests in blockchain and cryptography?","title":"Tianyu Wu:"},{"location":"articles/AMA/AConversationonCryptographyTrustMachineandCyberPlanetConstruction/#prof-kevin-mo_8","text":"It has taken humanity a few thousand years to build the whole physical infrastructure on earth which is the foundation of modern civilized living, with all its comfort and convenience.

It has taken humanity a few thousand years to build the whole physical infrastructure on earth which is the foundation of modern civilized living, with all its comfort and convenience. A similar process of construction is also needed for the newly born cyber planet, and the very foundation of this construction is the technology of trust machines.

Along with the growth of Bitcoin, we see an explosive development of various types of trust machine technologies. Most of them are based on either blockchain, or a combination of blockchain with something else. It is a very young age. So, we expect to see a long period when people will try many lines of development. However, I have the feeling that all these different developments will gradually merge into one Global Trust Machine, or Global Trust Infrastructure, with the following properties: 1. The Internet today as a network of connectivity will be transformed into a network of trust, on which any two strangers on earth can trust each other fully and instantly. This mutual trust is not based on moral evaluation of the other party, but rather on the powerful \u201ctrust machine technology\u201d which makes any violation of rules practically impossible. 2. All data from all individuals and institutions on earth are shared, as if in one huge single database. These data can be used in specific ways as authorized by the data owners. These authorizations will specify what computation is allowed, and to whom the results can be given. Beyond such authorized use, all data are kept in full privacy. 3. All computers in the world owned by different individuals and institutions are connected in such a way that they together function like a huge single computer, available for use by everyone. Again, this is done with full protection of privacy for all parties. 4. The organization of human society will be changed fundamentally. Traditionally, the primary function of most human organizations is to provide trust, namely, to act as a TTP. But this function will no longer be needed when the Global Trust Infrastructure becomes widely available. The implication is: most human organizations as we know today will disappear. 5. In particular, most of the business models we know today will disappear. Business models which are based on various forms of the monopoly of resources, such as data, information, special knowledge, and other privileges will gradually lose their overwhelming dominance. The whole economical structure will take a new form in which most values are given to those activities of actual products and services. On the other hand, sales as a profession, advertisement as an industry (which makes up about 2% of GDP today), may gradually disappear. In fact, the future is already happening now. The large-scale experimentation of DeFi since 2020 may eventually lead to the disappearance of all traditional financial institutions and the whole industry. This change will not stop with finance but will expand to the whole economy and the whole society in every aspect. This was what happened with the Internet in the past 25 years. I believe the trust machine technology, which includes blockchain in its initial form, is a much more disruptive technology than the Internet, with more profound consequences to human society. As regards research, we are building a new research team at Peking University. The area of research will be around the keywords like Cyberspace, Trust, Trust Machine, and new business models based on the new technology. I will touch upon a few points. 1. What is Cyberspace? We all vaguely know what cyberspace is. However, it is not yet a precisely defined scientific concept. The time may have come that we gain a more formal understanding of it. The first intuition of space comes from the 3-dimensional physical space, which can be extended to the 4-dimensional spacetimes. To describe the position of saying an airplane, you go to 5-dimensional space. To describe extended objects such as electromagnetic fields or the shape of an elastic body, you use function spaces which have infinite dimensions. All these types of spaces have the concept of continuity and various way of measurement in terms of distance, length, areas, and so on. In mathematics, another important type of space arises from the study of algebraic geometry and number theory, in which there can be found another type of continuity, as well as the various concepts of intersection between geometric configurations. But what is cyberspace? From a simplistic view, you can think of it as a collection of computer systems connected by a certain communication network in which many parties can interact with each other. But this description hardly indicates its highly non-trivial complexity. The real wonder of cyberspace emerges only with the deep study of cryptography, as roughly described in what we earlier described as Trust 1.0\u20134.0. These are all based on some very profound mathematical principle, the existence of one-way function, which implies the famous conjecture P\u2260NP. So, we see that cyberspace, namely the space of information, is really a quite strange animal. It is starkly different from any mathematical space we have encountered before. Its most important properties are derived from various non-invertibility of computation. To put it more quantitatively, it is about some asymmetry property of the computational process, measured by computational complexity. The times lock puzzle which later developed into the idea of verifiable delay function (VDF) shows this quantitative aspect more clearly. Another question is, is cyberspace a purely discrete object? So far, the science of cryptography has mostly been approached by a discrete view. However, much important information contained in the form of voice, image and video are inherently more of continuous objects, which cannot be fully modeled by a discrete view. So, is there a certain mathematical formulation of the concept of cyberspace, which can capture many of its important features, and serve as a foundation for future study? 2. Two Wings of Trust in Duality We have informally discussed trust and its two aspects: 1) proper behavior enforcement; 2) privacy. They set limits on what you can do, and what you can see respectively. This reminds us of an important phenomenon in control theory, the duality between observability and controllability. This duality principle was first discovered in linear control theory, mathematically expressed by matrix transposition. Interestingly, this duality is also found in non-linear control theory based on differential equations, and in automata theory. So, is there a similar duality in the context of cryptography? We have described blockchain as a half trust machine in the sense that it only limits what you do, but not what you see. In the general theory of MPC, we encounter another type of \u201chalf trust machine\u201d which is secure only under \u201csemi-honest\u201d assumption, namely that each party will voluntarily do only what they are supposed to do (but may try their best to know what they are not supposed to know). These two types of \u201chalf trust machines\u201d are apparently in some kind of duality. Interestingly, in both cases, the weakness can be fixed by zero-knowledge proof. transparent blockchain + ZKP \u2192 blockchain of privacy semi-honest secure MPC + ZKP \u2192 malicious secure MPC Figure 14: How ZKP Relationship to Privacy-Preserving Computation and Malicious Secure MPC We all know the wonder of the duality principle in mathematics. Starting with the duality between points and lines discovered in the early days of projective geometry, and later duality in the topology of manifold discovered by Poincare. Fourier transform is a kind of duality. There is also duality in optimization theory, linear programming, and so on. We have also heard about the duality which connects five different string theories into one M-theory. So, regarding the apparent duality we observed between the two aspects of trust, is it the result of some precise mathematical principle? Is there some kind of duality theory in cyberspace? 3. Trust Machine Construction The quick rise of blockchain since 2009 has captured the eyes of the world. However, I personally feel that blockchain is but the \u201ctoy car\u201d version of the much wider framework of Trust Machine Technology, which will be the real future. From the point of view of business application (or more general social application), the real need is a trust machine, of which blockchain is a remote approximation. Blockchain is something you can play with immediately for quick results. But from a research point of view, you need to look a bit more ahead and probe further into the fundamentals. Nowadays, there is a proliferation of experiments in this field, with vanilla blockchain, blockchain + ZKP, blockchain + storage, blockchain + data, blockchain +MPC, layer 2 solutions, cross-chain solutions, blockchain + TEE, and so on. All these are attempts to construct various forms of trust machine, using blockchain as a handy component. But there could be a different approach to the problem. The all-powerful trust machine from MPC has already solved nearly all problems in theory. The next step is to look for concrete constructions which strike a reasonable balance among functionality, efficiency, security, and other practical factors. For this purpose, it seems necessary to develop more precise and quantitative measures to these different factors, so that we can better evaluate the merits of any specific construction. We can also ask whether a particular construction is optimal under certain conditions. Given the above general view, we might also ask, what is blockchain as a trust machine? What is its place in trust machine construction in general? Should it occupy a central position, and if so, why? If not so, what are the other important tools? We see formal modeling of blockchain given in a 2015 paper on Hawk, which has such flavor. Another very important question is the composition of trust machines. As discussed earlier, all separate trust machines constructed for a certain domain application in the world should eventually merge into one Global Trust Infrastructure. Is this technically viable? How should it be done? Experiments on cross-chain solutions are trying to address this issue from an engineering point of view. However, it seems unlikely that this very complex problem can find its proper solution by such a trial and error approach alone. Some true innovations based on advanced cryptography seem needed. 4. New Business Models Trust machine in its ideal capacity (a highly efficient Global Trust Infrastructure) will render most of the traditional business model obsolete. However, present-day technology is not quite there yet. So, we expect a gradual process of evolution, with continuous technical and business innovation going hand in hand. Bitcoin has been a most successful case of such a double innovation. Note that the technology is highly original, yet of very low capacity. So, one needs to dig into various vertical domains and identify the right kind of use cases. Such cases should have two characteristics: 1) business-wise, it should be disruptive and highly impactful to its relevant domain; 2) technically, it should be within the capacity of today\u2019s technical innovation.","title":"Prof. Kevin Mo:"},{"location":"articles/AMA/AConversationonCryptographyTrustMachineandCyberPlanetConstruction/#question-9","text":"","title":"Question 9"},{"location":"articles/AMA/AConversationonCryptographyTrustMachineandCyberPlanetConstruction/#xinyu-tian_2","text":"In your presentation at the World Blockchain Congress 2021 in Hangzhou, you mentioned that the Internet Computer launched by DFINITY is one of the major breakthroughs in the mainstream of blockchain innovation in the past 10 years.

So, personally, I really like it very much and wish for its success. In principle, any blockchain with smart contract capacity, such as Ethereum, Algorand, and so on, has the flavor of infrastructure, a kind of open operating system on the Internet. But to really function as such, major technical progress is still needed. A practically useful infrastructure must have unlimited scalability in computation, communication, and storage capacity, and the ability to protect the privacy of both data and codes when required.

Special relativity applies to all physical phenomena in the absence of gravity. General relativity explains the law of gravitation and its relation to other forces of nature. It applies to the cosmological and astrophysical realm, including astronomy. Wikipedia 3. Quantum physics Quantum physics is the study of matter and energy at its most fundamental level. A central tenet of quantum physics is that energy comes in indivisible packets called quanta. Quanta behave very differently to macroscopic matter: particles can behave like waves, and waves behave as though they are particles. Nature 4. Zero-knowledge proof In cryptography , a zero-knowledge proof or zero-knowledge protocol is a method by which one party (the prover) can prove to another party (the verifier) that they know a value x, conveying no information apart from the fact that they know the value x. The essence of zero-knowledge proof is that it is trivial to prove that one possesses knowledge of certain information by simply revealing it; the challenge is to prove such possession without revealing the information itself or any additional information. Wikipedia 5. Homomorphic encryption Homomorphic encryption is encryption that permits users to perform computations on its encrypted data without first decrypting it. These resulting computations are left in an encrypted form which, when decrypted, resulting in an identical output to that produced had the operations been performed on the unencrypted data. Homomorphic encryption can be used for privacy-preserving outsourced storage and computation. This allows data to be encrypted and out-sourced to commercial cloud environments for processing, all while encrypted. Wikipedia 6. Secure multi-party computation Secure multi-party computation (also known as secure computation, multi-party computation (MPC), or privacy-preserving computation) is a subfield of cryptography with the goal of creating methods for parties to jointly compute a function over their inputs while keeping those inputs private. Unlike traditional cryptographic tasks, where cryptography ensures security and integrity of communication or storage and the adversary is outside the system of participants (an eavesdropper on the sender and receiver), the cryptography in this model protects participants\u2019 privacy from each other.

It refers to the online world as a world \u2018apart\u2019, as distinct from everyday reality. The term is described as the domain of the global technology environment, commonly defined as standing for the global network of interdependent information technology infrastructures, telecommunications networks, and computer processing systems.

PKI/HTTPS technology PKI: A public key infrastructure (PKI) is a set of roles, policies, hardware, software, and procedures needed to create, manage, distribute, use, store and revoke digital certificates and manage public-key encryption . The purpose of a PKI is to facilitate the secure electronic transfer of information for a range of network activities, such as e-commerce, internet banking, and confidential email. It is required for activities where simple passwords are an inadequate authentication method and the more rigorous proof is required to confirm the identity of the parties involved in the communication and to validate the information being transferred. HTTPS: Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) extends the Hypertext Transfer Protoco l (HTTP). It is used for secure communication over a computer network and is widely used on the Internet. In HTTPS, the communication protocol is encrypted using Transport Layer Securit y (TLS) or, formerly, Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). The protocol is therefore also referred to as HTTP over TLS, or HTTP over SSL. Wikipedia , Wikipedia 9.

SSL/TLS Transport Layer Security (TLS), the successor of the now-deprecated Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), is a cryptographic protocol designed to provide communications security over a computer network.

Trusted third party (TTP) In cryptography, a trusted third party (TTP) is an entity that facilitates interactions between two parties who both trust the third party; the Third Party reviews all critical transaction communications between the parties, based on the ease of creating fraudulent digital content. In TTP models, the relying parties use this trust to secure their own interactions. TTPs are common in any number of commercial transactions and in cryptographic digital transactions as well as cryptographic protocols. For example, a certificate authority (CA) would issue a digital certificate to one of the two parties in the next example. The CA then becomes the Trusted-Third-Party to that certificate\u2019s issuance. Likewise, transactions that need third-party recordation would also need a third-party repository service of some kind or another. Wikipedia 12.

In general terms, the TEE offers an execution space that provides a higher level of security for trusted applications running on the device than a rich operating system (OS) and more functionality than a \u2018secure element\u2019 (SE).

Read the Interview Scripts with annotations and citations. Questions 1 William: How did you come up with the idea of Liquity? While many decentralized borrowing protocols have already been developed (MakerDAO [1] for example), how does Liquity differ from other borrowing protocols? Dr. Lauko: Figure 3: Liquity Hey William, thank you for having me. I am pleased to be in this show. Let me start by giving you a bit of background about the story of Liquity. While I was working at DFINITY, I just started looking into DeFi protocols that were available at that time. Among them, of course, MakerDAO but there was also Compound [2], and there was a protocol back then called ETHland which later became Aave [3]. So those were the protocols that I had a chance to look at that time, and I just realized that they were all interesting, but somehow they weren\u2019t as efficient as maybe they could have been. Because the way they did or still do liquidations is time-consuming or involves fixed discounts when they finally sell the collateral. Looking at those systems, I realized that I had my own ideas and potential improvements in mind. How to make liquidations faster and even instantaneous? The idea became more and more concrete over time and in November 2019 I left DFINITY to fully focus on Liquity. I was incredibly lucky that I found my co-founder Rick Pardoe who is based in the UK. Now he is the lead engineer, but back then he was the only core Solidity developer. Even though I started with my own prototype in Solidity, I am not a solidity coder. I was only able to create this prototype, and then Rick took over, and the protocol started to shape up. So basically it all started with the efficiency of liquidations. Later we also added other aspects and benefits including the interest-free-ness. We weren\u2019t sure at the beginning whether there would be fees and how we would collect them. It turned out that we didn\u2019t want to have interest rates because they make the loans more unpredictable, we wanted to offer a more predictable and smoother borrowing experience. So the whole system targets the borrowers and is trying to make the borrowing experience as good as possible. So it\u2019s not solely a stable coin project, even though the LUSD token is a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar. You could call the stablecoin a byproduct, though it\u2019s an important one. Still, we are a borrowing protocol at our core. That\u2019s how it all started. William: That sounds great! I agree that Liquity definitely provides more benefits than only being a stablecoin and that\u2019s really important. We know that Liquity has been deployed on Ethereum for four months. Are there any updates regarding the protocol? Are you satisfied with the performance of the platform up to now? Dr. Lauko: Figure 4: Liquity Official Website Yes, I was literally blown away by our success in the first few days of our protocol. So we launched on April 5, and within the first 10 days, Liquity reached a TVL [4] of more than 1 billion US dollars, which was crazy. I mean, I wouldn\u2019t have even dreamed of that in my wildest dreams. But it happened, and it went up to almost five or five and a half billion US dollars, now it has stabilized around 2.5 billion. So it was an incredible early growth, also thanks to our very radical early adopter incentive program. We have the stability pool in our system which backs the loans, and by becoming a stability depositor you also get rewarded in our secondary token LQTY, and the way the system mints and distributes the LQTY by is heavily weighted towards the early adopters. So it made sense for them to jump on as early as possible, which then fuelled the whole system with more fee revenue. That kickstarted the whole cycle. I think the early success of the protocol was extremely important because it also helped us to be in the media and have some echo on Twitter and just make sure that people start talking about Liquity. Yeah, I am really happy with how this all worked out because I wasn\u2019t sure at the beginning whether our system will be used. Maybe it could have gone wrong, but it turned out to be successful. Questions 2 Xinyu: Thank you so much for sharing your story behind the industry. The pathway is really inspiring to us. In the past year, we see a boom in decentralized finance on the Ethereum blockchain. As an industry practitioner, what do you think about the prospect of DeFi? What are the key advantages of operating on the blockchain compared to a centralized system, and what are the potential disadvantages? Dr. Lauko: Figure 5: DeFi That\u2019s a great question. There are disadvantages and advantages, of course. I think one of the main advantages is that you can automate things. You can basically do away with intermediaries, with human interaction. So you can make everything more predictable because you can set the rules in stone. You can make sure that by making it transparent, people know exactly what they have to expect \u2014 they know exactly when they get liquidated, and they know exactly what they have to pay. I think this really changes the way people interact with financial products. That\u2019s one of the advantages. Another advantage is that you can make them much more efficient. There is always an open market for crypto, for example, while the stock market closes on the weekend. Even that shows how much more efficient crypto trading, for example, can be. So I think there are many ways of automating things, making them more efficient and more cost-efficient as well, by cutting out the intermediaries. You have fewer people taking their share, so you can offer the resulting product at a much more attractive price. I think those are the pros. On the con side, depending on how the protocol is structured, it can be a problem that decentralized applications are more static. Sometimes a human intervention can be an advantage because humans can adapt to changes that you couldn\u2019t foresee as a protocol developer. So in Liquity it\u2019s not possible at all to change the protocol. In other systems, there may be a governance mechanism, but who knows whether it will decide the way it should. A central entity can lead to a fairer outcome or to results that people would prefer. And maybe another advantage of centralized exchanges is the human aspect, the fact that you as a human can interact with other humans. Some people may prefer having a partner whom they can talk to and who is in charge or responsible for a product or service. While in DeFi, this may be less obvious. There are even teams that are fully anonymous or products that just live on by themselves, without having an owner or admin. Or, they are even abandoned, but they still keep working. Some people may be a bit confused and would not trust such a system. So, there are pros and cons for sure. Questions 3 William: I totally agree, I think your insights about the pros and cons of DeFi are really important to us. The third question is that there are already different versions of Liquity deployed on various blockchains (Binance Smart Chain (BSC) for example). There are also projects aiming to deploy Liquity to Internet Computer (IC). What do you think about the prospects of these public blockchains? Dr. Lauko: I think we have to differentiate between the future of those blockchains as infrastructure projects and the future of DeFi. Because I think some newer blockchain protocols have a much broader use case or scope than just DeFi. An important presentation given by Vitalik Buterin in Paris, a few weeks ago at the EthCC, made it clear that Ethereum shouldn\u2019t be just about DeFi, because blockchains could offer much more than financial products; they could also tap into the social media space, for example. And I think that was a very interesting talk because that\u2019s what other blockchains are now currently pursuing and maybe they are more advanced in that sense than Ethereum. For example, DFINITY is pushing the boundaries of being scalable and much faster and cost-efficient than Ethereum. We have already seen some interesting applications being built on top of DFINITY that would be never possible technically on Ethereum. And there is also Solana, which is targeted to become more efficient than Ethereum. Then the question is: do we need all the efficiency and scalability for DeFi? And this is a difficult question. I think even though Ethereum has its issues with the gas costs, it\u2019s slow and can only evolve through hard forks, but it already has a thriving DeFi ecosystem on Ethereum. And while it may not be optimal, it still works. And the question is, would it become much better if we move to more efficient chains? Here I\u2019m not sure. I think it depends on the application, in particular. For example, the way the decentralized exchanges are designed now on Ethereum is influenced by Ethereum\u2019s low throughput and low scalability. That\u2019s why we only have pool-based systems like Uniswap for token exchanges, because you cannot replicate order-book [5] based dynamics or a traditional trading platform on Ethereum. It just doesn\u2019t work because it\u2019s too slow and it would be too expensive. But now, with DFINITY, I think that would become possible and maybe we will also see more order-book based systems pop up in the future. Now Liquity is a bit of a different story, because Liquity is a loan platform. It\u2019s a borrowing protocol, where users would take out a loan, but only change the loan like repaying some portion or take out more, maybe every week or month or not even that often. So maintaining a loan is not the same as being a trader. The traders may do 10 trades a day or even 100 trades or more. For them, speed and cost efficiency are much more important than for a borrower on Liquity, who may not care too much: you could open your position and maybe in a year you repay. That\u2019s why our strategy around layer two solutions and other chains is not very urgent for now. We don\u2019t feel a pressing need to be everywhere and to make sure that people can open Liquity loans on every layer 2 chain, because I don\u2019t think there is a very clear need for it. But of course it would be nice to eventually offer that. Maybe I can quickly come back to the last part of your first question, because I\u2019m not sure if I answered it. We just recently started working on a second project that could extend the scope of Liquity as a native stablecoin borrowing system. On Compound, for example, you can borrow existing tokens and you can collateralize them with other existing tokens. We want to create something similar, but without charging an interest rate. It would be similar to Liquity in the fact that there is no interest rate but some upfront fee that you pay when you take out your loan and that\u2019s it. While we were working on this idea, we also realized that this kind of idea could also benefit the current ecosystem of Liquity. And we could also do it in a way to make it work on multiple different chains. Ideally, we could deploy it to several networks once implemented, but we don\u2019t need to decide this for the time being. William: Thank you Dr. Lauko, it\u2019s really great to hear that there might be Liquity version two or Eureka as you mentioned. I think this is really exciting information for us. I totally agree that this is a great idea. I think it will help us a lot to improve the user experience when users can not only use Ethers as collateral but also other tokens. So that\u2019s all of our questions. Thank you so much for taking us into our interview today, and thank you so much for providing us with these insights.

While many decentralized borrowing protocols have already been developed (MakerDAO [1] for example), how does Liquity differ from other borrowing protocols? Dr. Lauko: Figure 3: Liquity Hey William, thank you for having me. I am pleased to be in this show. Let me start by giving you a bit of background about the story of Liquity. While I was working at DFINITY, I just started looking into DeFi protocols that were available at that time. Among them, of course, MakerDAO but there was also Compound [2], and there was a protocol back then called ETHland which later became Aave [3]. So those were the protocols that I had a chance to look at that time, and I just realized that they were all interesting, but somehow they weren\u2019t as efficient as maybe they could have been. Because the way they did or still do liquidations is time-consuming or involves fixed discounts when they finally sell the collateral. Looking at those systems, I realized that I had my own ideas and potential improvements in mind. How to make liquidations faster and even instantaneous? The idea became more and more concrete over time and in November 2019 I left DFINITY to fully focus on Liquity. I was incredibly lucky that I found my co-founder Rick Pardoe who is based in the UK. Now he is the lead engineer, but back then he was the only core Solidity developer. Even though I started with my own prototype in Solidity, I am not a solidity coder. I was only able to create this prototype, and then Rick took over, and the protocol started to shape up. So basically it all started with the efficiency of liquidations. Later we also added other aspects and benefits including the interest-free-ness. We weren\u2019t sure at the beginning whether there would be fees and how we would collect them. It turned out that we didn\u2019t want to have interest rates because they make the loans more unpredictable, we wanted to offer a more predictable and smoother borrowing experience. So the whole system targets the borrowers and is trying to make the borrowing experience as good as possible. So it\u2019s not solely a stable coin project, even though the LUSD token is a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar. You could call the stablecoin a byproduct, though it\u2019s an important one. Still, we are a borrowing protocol at our core. That\u2019s how it all started. William: That sounds great! I agree that Liquity definitely provides more benefits than only being a stablecoin and that\u2019s really important. We know that Liquity has been deployed on Ethereum for four months. Are there any updates regarding the protocol? Are you satisfied with the performance of the platform up to now? Dr. Lauko: Figure 4: Liquity Official Website Yes, I was literally blown away by our success in the first few days of our protocol. So we launched on April 5, and within the first 10 days, Liquity reached a TVL [4] of more than 1 billion US dollars, which was crazy. I mean, I wouldn\u2019t have even dreamed of that in my wildest dreams. But it happened, and it went up to almost five or five and a half billion US dollars, now it has stabilized around 2.5 billion. So it was an incredible early growth, also thanks to our very radical early adopter incentive program. We have the stability pool in our system which backs the loans, and by becoming a stability depositor you also get rewarded in our secondary token LQTY, and the way the system mints and distributes the LQTY by is heavily weighted towards the early adopters. So it made sense for them to jump on as early as possible, which then fuelled the whole system with more fee revenue. That kickstarted the whole cycle. I think the early success of the protocol was extremely important because it also helped us to be in the media and have some echo on Twitter and just make sure that people start talking about Liquity. Yeah, I am really happy with how this all worked out because I wasn\u2019t sure at the beginning whether our system will be used. Maybe it could have gone wrong, but it turned out to be successful.","title":"Questions 1"},{"location":"articles/AMA/AGlanceintoLiquity/#questions-2","text":"Xinyu: Thank you so much for sharing your story behind the industry. The pathway is really inspiring to us. In the past year, we see a boom in decentralized finance on the Ethereum blockchain. As an industry practitioner, what do you think about the prospect of DeFi? What are the key advantages of operating on the blockchain compared to a centralized system, and what are the potential disadvantages? Dr. Lauko: Figure 5: DeFi That\u2019s a great question. There are disadvantages and advantages, of course. I think one of the main advantages is that you can automate things. You can basically do away with intermediaries, with human interaction. So you can make everything more predictable because you can set the rules in stone. You can make sure that by making it transparent, people know exactly what they have to expect \u2014 they know exactly when they get liquidated, and they know exactly what they have to pay. I think this really changes the way people interact with financial products. That\u2019s one of the advantages. Another advantage is that you can make them much more efficient. There is always an open market for crypto, for example, while the stock market closes on the weekend. Even that shows how much more efficient crypto trading, for example, can be. So I think there are many ways of automating things, making them more efficient and more cost-efficient as well, by cutting out the intermediaries. You have fewer people taking their share, so you can offer the resulting product at a much more attractive price. I think those are the pros. On the con side, depending on how the protocol is structured, it can be a problem that decentralized applications are more static. Sometimes a human intervention can be an advantage because humans can adapt to changes that you couldn\u2019t foresee as a protocol developer. So in Liquity it\u2019s not possible at all to change the protocol. In other systems, there may be a governance mechanism, but who knows whether it will decide the way it should. A central entity can lead to a fairer outcome or to results that people would prefer. And maybe another advantage of centralized exchanges is the human aspect, the fact that you as a human can interact with other humans. Some people may prefer having a partner whom they can talk to and who is in charge or responsible for a product or service. While in DeFi, this may be less obvious. There are even teams that are fully anonymous or products that just live on by themselves, without having an owner or admin. Or, they are even abandoned, but they still keep working.

Figure 2: Introduction to retail CBDC vs other payment methods. Source: BIS Question 1 Francesco : What is the biggest change Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) can bring to the financial system as well as the global economy? Luciano: Unlike what people may mistakenly think, CBDCs are not only about technology. Yes, they have the potential to speed up payment systems, cut transaction costs, and improve financial inclusion, but it\u2019s more than meets the eye. CBDCs are designed to bring a radical change in how money works . Today, you can either pay by cash or credit card. Cash is essentially a liability of a country\u2019s central bank, which acts as a guarantor of a transaction between two parties. On the other hand, whenever individuals pay with credit cards, they are transacting bank credits, which are denominated in a domestic or international currency, such as the dollar. However, bank credits are not dollars because if a bank goes bankrupt, bank credits are worth nothing to its depositors. Similarly, banks normally have an account at a country\u2019s central bank, where they settle transactions with other banks at the end of each day. This is how our global payment system works today. The future of payments will likely be different from what we have been used to in the past. Governments and central banks around the world are thinking of allowing everybody to open a deposit account at the central bank . In other words, if you go to Walmart and pay for your groceries, you are exchanging a central bank\u2019s liability, not a bank\u2019s. This may have marginal implications for the end customer, other than being a slightly cheaper, faster means of payment, but it has great implications for everything that happens behind the curtains. For example, if a bank\u2019s depositor wants to transfer her money to a newly opened bank account at the central bank, it is worth understanding how the transfer will take place between the two banks. It raises important questions like: - Should the central bank compensate commercial banks for the loss of deposits? - Should we be worried about disintermediation? - Who is going to distribute the digital currency? - Is the central bank collecting transaction data? (today central banks do not have access to granular payment data) - Who\u2019s collecting transaction data that are currently not available to central banks on a granular level? In terms of how CBDCs will be designed, there is a fundamental choice to make: a token-based or an account-based CBDC . With a token-based CBDC, a payment\u2019s receiver verifies the authenticity of the token, just like with physical banknotes. An account-based CBDC would resemble a normal bank deposit. Either way, central banks will likely set in the beginning a maximum limit on the amount of digital currency in your e-wallet, thus restricting its use to small transactions. Figure 3: Account-based vs Token-based CBDC. Source: BIS Question 2 Francesco : An external observer may feel overwhelmed by the number of emerging technologies that are redefining the global financial system. So, what do you envision to be the future of money? Luciano : Politics will be exceptionally crucial in determining what the future of money in 2030 might look like. My best guess is that CBDCs will likely establish themselves as the most widely used means of payment in the next 15 to 20 year s. Whether CBDCs will be token-based or account-based is still to be determined, but it would not be surprising to see a hybrid CBDC design being implemented. Governments must also address questions about the distribution channels of their own CBDC. Will CBDCs be distributed directly by central banks, crowding out commercial bank deposits? Or, will central banks pass the funds through the commercial banks, which will act as intermediaries of the CBDC? Although central banks around the world are currently exploring both options, CBDCs are most likely to be distributed by commercial banks, leaving the environment for banks unchanged. Traditional private cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, are not money since they are not used for payments. Instead, individuals tend to use Bitcoin for speculative, hedging, and diversification purposes. Evidence from a financial firm\u2019s proprietary data shows that there exists a strong substitution effect between some speculative assets and bitcoin. In some developing countries with high inflation rates, however, private cryptocurrencies can represent an attractive alternative to fiat money or cards. Stablecoins, on the other hand, might play an important role, but there is a risk associated with government intervention. This was the case, for example, in China, where the government has imposed a 100 percent reserve requirement to Alipay, meaning that every time a customer converts some Chinese yuan into Alipay money, the firm must deposit the same amount in the central bank. In other words, Alipay is a synthetic CBDC because it is 100 percent backed by the central bank. You just have an intermediary in the middle who is taking care of the payment technology. This was done out of political considerations. One might agree or disagree, but whenever you have powerful intermediaries in an economy, regulators often start getting worried about their role. The same happened with Libra in the US, where the government was reluctant to allow Facebook to pursue monetary experiments. Therefore, regulators will most likely step in whenever a private means of payment becomes too influential by either imposing stricter regulation or by issuing their own CBDC. Figure 4: Retail CBDC design. Source: BIS Question 3 Francesco : We read your article published in the Financial Times-Alphaville titled \u201c CBDCs must be coupled with greater accountability .\u201d In this article, you focused on the influences of CBDC on the balance sheets of the European Central Bank and the Federal Reserve. Can you summarize the pros and cons of introducing CBDCs for different stakeholders, such as central banks, commercial banks, and individuals? Luciano : From a consumer\u2019s perspective, the advantages of CBDCs are quite marginal. Domestic and cross-border transactions might be cheaper and faster. It might also be easier for merchants to offer different virtual transactions. On the other hand, the introduction of CBDCs will have a larger impact on commercial banks, which might see a decrease in the number of deposits . If commercial banks do lose deposits, then it will become much harder for them to offer complementary financial services, and they could no longer draw on deposits as their main source of funding. Central banks can potentially address this problem by collecting deposits and funding commercial banks directly. Under such a scenario, commercial banks would still be able to retain all customer data, provide complementary services, and attract new customers. Ultimately, central banks will be the ones who will experience the biggest change from the introduction of a CBDC since they will have retailers in their balance sheet, regardless of whether CBDCs will be distributed through them or via banks. A direct channel between central banks and retailers will result in more targeted monetary policies at the expense of customers\u2019 privacy. Furthermore, part of what my research has been focusing on, introducing a CBDC under quantitative easing programs may have profound consequences on a central bank\u2019s ability to reverse its expansionary monetary policies . When commercial banks use their excess reserves to allow depositors to convert bank deposits into CBDC deposits, retailers become the new creditors of the central bank. Then, it might be more difficult \u2014 yet not impossible \u2014 to convince retailers to give back their deposits when a central bank is determined to taper its balance sheet. So, tapering a balance sheet when liabilities are in the hand of retailers is much harder, rendering QE program quasi-permanent eventually. Figure 5: ECB and Fed\u2019s balance sheets from 2006 to 2022. Source: Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis Question 4 Francesco : How will a CBDC affect the effectiveness of monetary policy during the period of a financial crisis? Will CBDC deteriorate or mitigate inflation? Luciano : In terms of the effectiveness of monetary policy in times of financial crises, central banks can benefit from CBDCs because they will be able to implement more targeted monetary policies, by directly affecting households\u2019 deposits. This might facilitate the integration of fiscal and monetary policies , thus blurring the line between the responsibilities of the central bank and those of the fiscal authorities. Also, you might see central banks trying to do much more precise targeting of inflation because the instrument is much better at micromanaging monetary policies . On the other hand, the problem may arise in the long-term where people will start to think that central banks have monetary superpowers and can print money indefinitely, resulting in changes in inflation expectation. As you can imagine, it becomes very difficult to predict the general equilibrium effect of CBDCs on inflation. The question that policymakers ought to be asked is: \u201cDo the benefits of introducing a CBDC outweigh the costs? And is the risk worth taking?\u201d In my opinion \u2014 which is not reflected in my research \u2014 the risks of introducing a CBDC are enormous. When assessing the risks associated with this technology, central bankers should consider the effects in 20 or 30 years, regardless of whether CBDCs will be used only for payments or other more sophisticated purposes.

Yes, they have the potential to speed up payment systems, cut transaction costs, and improve financial inclusion, but it\u2019s more than meets the eye. CBDCs are designed to bring a radical change in how money works . Today, you can either pay by cash or credit card. Cash is essentially a liability of a country\u2019s central bank, which acts as a guarantor of a transaction between two parties. On the other hand, whenever individuals pay with credit cards, they are transacting bank credits, which are denominated in a domestic or international currency, such as the dollar. However, bank credits are not dollars because if a bank goes bankrupt, bank credits are worth nothing to its depositors. Similarly, banks normally have an account at a country\u2019s central bank, where they settle transactions with other banks at the end of each day. This is how our global payment system works today. The future of payments will likely be different from what we have been used to in the past. Governments and central banks around the world are thinking of allowing everybody to open a deposit account at the central bank . In other words, if you go to Walmart and pay for your groceries, you are exchanging a central bank\u2019s liability, not a bank\u2019s. This may have marginal implications for the end customer, other than being a slightly cheaper, faster means of payment, but it has great implications for everything that happens behind the curtains. For example, if a bank\u2019s depositor wants to transfer her money to a newly opened bank account at the central bank, it is worth understanding how the transfer will take place between the two banks. It raises important questions like: - Should the central bank compensate commercial banks for the loss of deposits? - Should we be worried about disintermediation? - Who is going to distribute the digital currency? - Is the central bank collecting transaction data? (today central banks do not have access to granular payment data) - Who\u2019s collecting transaction data that are currently not available to central banks on a granular level? In terms of how CBDCs will be designed, there is a fundamental choice to make: a token-based or an account-based CBDC . With a token-based CBDC, a payment\u2019s receiver verifies the authenticity of the token, just like with physical banknotes. An account-based CBDC would resemble a normal bank deposit. Either way, central banks will likely set in the beginning a maximum limit on the amount of digital currency in your e-wallet, thus restricting its use to small transactions.

So, what do you envision to be the future of money? Luciano : Politics will be exceptionally crucial in determining what the future of money in 2030 might look like. My best guess is that CBDCs will likely establish themselves as the most widely used means of payment in the next 15 to 20 year s. Whether CBDCs will be token-based or account-based is still to be determined, but it would not be surprising to see a hybrid CBDC design being implemented. Governments must also address questions about the distribution channels of their own CBDC. Will CBDCs be distributed directly by central banks, crowding out commercial bank deposits? Or, will central banks pass the funds through the commercial banks, which will act as intermediaries of the CBDC? Although central banks around the world are currently exploring both options, CBDCs are most likely to be distributed by commercial banks, leaving the environment for banks unchanged. Traditional private cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, are not money since they are not used for payments. Instead, individuals tend to use Bitcoin for speculative, hedging, and diversification purposes. Evidence from a financial firm\u2019s proprietary data shows that there exists a strong substitution effect between some speculative assets and bitcoin. In some developing countries with high inflation rates, however, private cryptocurrencies can represent an attractive alternative to fiat money or cards. Stablecoins, on the other hand, might play an important role, but there is a risk associated with government intervention. This was the case, for example, in China, where the government has imposed a 100 percent reserve requirement to Alipay, meaning that every time a customer converts some Chinese yuan into Alipay money, the firm must deposit the same amount in the central bank. In other words, Alipay is a synthetic CBDC because it is 100 percent backed by the central bank. You just have an intermediary in the middle who is taking care of the payment technology. This was done out of political considerations. One might agree or disagree, but whenever you have powerful intermediaries in an economy, regulators often start getting worried about their role. The same happened with Libra in the US, where the government was reluctant to allow Facebook to pursue monetary experiments. Therefore, regulators will most likely step in whenever a private means of payment becomes too influential by either imposing stricter regulation or by issuing their own CBDC.

Can you summarize the pros and cons of introducing CBDCs for different stakeholders, such as central banks, commercial banks, and individuals? Luciano : From a consumer\u2019s perspective, the advantages of CBDCs are quite marginal. Domestic and cross-border transactions might be cheaper and faster. It might also be easier for merchants to offer different virtual transactions. On the other hand, the introduction of CBDCs will have a larger impact on commercial banks, which might see a decrease in the number of deposits . If commercial banks do lose deposits, then it will become much harder for them to offer complementary financial services, and they could no longer draw on deposits as their main source of funding. Central banks can potentially address this problem by collecting deposits and funding commercial banks directly. Under such a scenario, commercial banks would still be able to retain all customer data, provide complementary services, and attract new customers. Ultimately, central banks will be the ones who will experience the biggest change from the introduction of a CBDC since they will have retailers in their balance sheet, regardless of whether CBDCs will be distributed through them or via banks. A direct channel between central banks and retailers will result in more targeted monetary policies at the expense of customers\u2019 privacy. Furthermore, part of what my research has been focusing on, introducing a CBDC under quantitative easing programs may have profound consequences on a central bank\u2019s ability to reverse its expansionary monetary policies . When commercial banks use their excess reserves to allow depositors to convert bank deposits into CBDC deposits, retailers become the new creditors of the central bank. Then, it might be more difficult \u2014 yet not impossible \u2014 to convince retailers to give back their deposits when a central bank is determined to taper its balance sheet. So, tapering a balance sheet when liabilities are in the hand of retailers is much harder, rendering QE program quasi-permanent eventually.

Will CBDC deteriorate or mitigate inflation? Luciano : In terms of the effectiveness of monetary policy in times of financial crises, central banks can benefit from CBDCs because they will be able to implement more targeted monetary policies, by directly affecting households\u2019 deposits. This might facilitate the integration of fiscal and monetary policies , thus blurring the line between the responsibilities of the central bank and those of the fiscal authorities. Also, you might see central banks trying to do much more precise targeting of inflation because the instrument is much better at micromanaging monetary policies . On the other hand, the problem may arise in the long-term where people will start to think that central banks have monetary superpowers and can print money indefinitely, resulting in changes in inflation expectation. As you can imagine, it becomes very difficult to predict the general equilibrium effect of CBDCs on inflation. The question that policymakers ought to be asked is: \u201cDo the benefits of introducing a CBDC outweigh the costs? And is the risk worth taking?\u201d In my opinion \u2014 which is not reflected in my research \u2014 the risks of introducing a CBDC are enormous. When assessing the risks associated with this technology, central bankers should consider the effects in 20 or 30 years, regardless of whether CBDCs will be used only for payments or other more sophisticated purposes.

Question 1 William: Let\u2019s start with your very influential Wall Street Journal Article Ban Cryptocurrency to Fight Ransomware . In the article, you wrote, \u201cI have been studying the crypto market since its inception, and I have yet to identify a single task or process that crypto makes easier, better, cheaper, or faster.\u201d Do you think the cryptocurrency market is completely a bubble? Mr. Reiners: The short answer is yes \u2014 I do think it is a bubble. My views have evolved a bit since I wrote that it would be a bubble. It would be helpful to repeat some context in terms of why I wrote that. For folks who might not be familiar, that was the aftermath of the Colonial Pipeline. Last May, there was a ransomware attack on an oil pipeline in the US, which resulted in gasoline shortages throughout the east coast here in the US. In Durham, North Carolina, people couldn\u2019t get gasoline for about a week. My wife and I went on vacation when the event occurred. We flew back home, but we couldn\u2019t get an Uber to take us from the airport back home because they failed to get gas. It struck me, and I started to think about the situation. For many Americans, ransomware impacted them personally. We all certainly have read about it and heard about these incidents. Many people think that ransomware was probably made by cryptocurrency. Ransomware does predate crypto, but it was neither of the magnitude nor front-page news like ransomware is now. We are facing very real social costs and economic costs. I decided that the costs vastly outweigh the benefits. We\u2019d better heavily restrict cryptocurrencies usage. When I look at some crypto innovations, such as stable coins, there might be a genuine economic benefit there, but I certainly think the space is a bubble. A bubble is one of those things where it\u2019s easy to spot in hindsight and almost impossible to predict. I think it\u2019s clear when looking at digital assets in general. People buy them because they believe they can sell them for a higher price in the future, regardless of the economic fundamentals. And that certainly applies to why people buy bitcoin. It is not because they can use it for something since there is really limited transaction value. People expect to sell it to someone for a higher price in the future. They are relying on the greater fool theory [1]. At some point, the supply of greater fools will be exhausted. Financial goals are fueled by some narrative going back to 2008, the global financial crisis. Despite the great depression, people forgot about it. The narrative has been solidified in recent years that crypto and Bitcoin are digital gold because only 21 million bitcoins are ever put into circulation. The crypto is a hedge against the inflation rate and the broader stock market with a limited supply. It is a good store of value as well. The narrative is breaking down as we see inflation at its highest level. The cryptocurrency prices have plummeted in recent months. People are starting to see the narrative shift a little bit to Web3 in the future: since we will all have control over data and information, cryptocurrency will be the grease to skid all of this. We will see if that comes to fruition. I am skeptical, but that was a long-winded answer there. Cryptocurrency will go away, although there\u2019s too much talent and money investment. Therefore, there is a bubble that will burst at some point. Beyond speculation, maybe there are still stable coins. It\u2019s hard to predict currently, just like the Internet did not go away after the dot com bubble in the late 90s early 2000s. We still see genuine innovation, but the bubble will burst. Maybe something useful will emerge, but do we need 5000 different cryptocurrencies? It is just a matter of who will be the winners and that no one can predict right now. William: Thank you. A quick follow-up question: I agree that bitcoin has seen very few practical use cases in reality, but what about the NFT market and digital arts? Do you think they are also part of the bubble you described? Mr. Reiners: Yes, I do think they are part of the bubble. There is a digital artist who did an NFT which goes off Christie\u2019s, and it was $60 million now. Does anyone genuinely think that 10 years from now, the piece of NFT of digital art will go for $60 million or more? I highly doubt it. I see the appeal allowing artists and other creators to monetize their work, attract fans, and deepen fan engagement. In this sense, NFT does have some staying power. NFT needs blockchain, and blockchain needs crypto. Things are changing now because rates are going up. With Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, there is heightened uncertainty in the global economy. We have been living in an extraordinary period of low interest rates that has compelled us to search for yield assets, including stocks, cryptos, NFTs. I find it funny when the Federal Reserve notes they\u2019re going to raise interest rates, crypto goes down as if somehow they\u2019re related. But that\u2019s how the market is reacting. I do think NFT has a chance of staying permanently, but I also see a major correction coming very soon. Question 2 Zhitong: In your paper Bitcoin Futures: From Self-Certification to Systemic Risk , you discussed the systematic risk that could be brought by Bitcoin Futures . Can you elaborate on why you think so? More generally, we are eager to know whether you think the frenzy in the cryptocurrency market will bring systematic risk to the financial system. Mr. Reiners: That is a good question. It was not that long ago that we had the crypto market. The regular traditional financial system was not connecting the two. The interconnections were limited. It has completely changed, and one of the pivotal moments when it did change was in 2017. Bitcoin cash and futures contracts come to market. I was very critical of the decision and will discuss more crypto regulations. Derivatives and futures have their origins in agricultural markets. Farmers plant crops in the spring, and harvest and sell that crop in the fall. Since they are exposed to price risk, they might want to hedge that by signing a futures contract in the spring, guaranteeing to deliver a certain amount of green or corn at a certain price and a certain date. Speculators use derivative contracts and futures contracts. There are still genuine economic users and hedgers. However, the market looks quite different. They are cash-settled, and bitcoin is never exchanged at any point in these transactions. Say, William, I will sell you one bitcoin in one month, for $50,000. In one month, if the price of bitcoin rises to $55,000, then I can just give William $5,000. That is cash settle. This opens the bitcoin market to a new set of investors. Maybe they were worried about having custody of their private key right, or they didn\u2019t want to deal with a lightly-regulated exchange they were concerned with. But now, you can go to the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and buy a regulated futures contract. You never need to touch bitcoin and worry about those issues. It opens up the investor base, but it also creates new risks. Broadly speaking, when we talk about systemic risks, what are the features that create them? One is the overall size of the market. Again, crypto at this point is volatile, but it\u2019s still a 2 trillion market, which is much larger than it was in 2017. Another factor is leverage. We see increasing leverage in the crypto space offered by different exchanges. It\u2019s hard to get leverage in the US for various reasons, but many exchanges in Asia provide leverage. Then it\u2019s just how transparent the market is. With the light regulation, we have little visibility into space. When combining all the factors, it\u2019s clear that crypto could pose a systemic risk. While the market is still not big enough in that if Bitcoin and Ether go to zero tomorrow, I don\u2019t think an average person would feel it in any meaningful way. Nor do I think it would bring down a large financial institution. But as the crypto market evolves rapidly and continues to grow, it will pose a systemic risk very soon, and it will threaten financial stability. My background is a regulator at the New York Fed. If people want to gamble or speculate on worthless assets, that is fine. It is their issue. What I am worried about is the negative externalities. For example, what is going on in crypto could impact financial stability. We are seeing all the traditional financial intermediary functions play a role in crypto. The irony is that with all the premises on decentralization and bypassing intermediaries, the whole ecosystem is now filled with intermediaries and with the same type of concentration playing out. I think we should all be worried about the risks that are being created here. Questions 3 William: Prior to joining Duke Law, you worked for five years at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, first as a supervisor of systemically important financial institutions and then as a senior associate within the executive office. There must be a moment when you got the inspiration for blockchain and law-related topics from your past experience. How do you think this experience of financial regulation has contributed to your current career success? Also, we would like to learn more about your expectation for the future of fintech and blockchain, and your thoughts regarding the impacts of the emergence of cryptocurrencies on market regulations in the future. Mr. Reiners: Where you stand depends on where you sit. My views on cryptocurrency are informed by the work I did at the New York FED and others\u2019 life experiences, just as anyone\u2019s view is informed by their life experiences. However, the real pivotal moment in my professional career was in 2008, the global financial crisis, when the U.S. financial system essentially melted down. Later, I have spent my professional career studying and understanding and trying to prevent it. So I see so many parallels with what transpired leading up to 2008 in crypto. It starts with innovation. This innovation is going to solve some problems. In 2008, it was derivatives, mortgage-backed securities, and default swaps. It made credit more accessible. It was going to promote homeownership and all these wonderful things. And there\u2019s no downside, so it doesn\u2019t need to be regulated, right? You see the exact same thing play out now. Blockchain bypasses intermediary, it\u2019s fully transparent, there\u2019s no downside, this is the innovation, this is the future, so don\u2019t get in the way. We\u2019ve heard this before. However, the collective memories are short. Unregulated financial innovation can do serious damage to our economy. Social and political issues further give rise to welfare inequality that we are all concerned about now. For middle-income and low-income folks, houses were their biggest investment when housing prices fell after 2008. However, wealthy people hold a higher percentage of their wealth in the stock market, and stock prices recovered relatively more quickly. This exacerbated wealth inequality and led to the rise of extremist politicians. People like Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump emerged as a result. There are all sorts of unintended consequences. What does the future of crypto regulation look like? I am a bit pessimistic at this point, to be honest with you. When looking at the history of financial law in the U.S., it generally occurs in the wake of some type of crisis. In 2008, we had the mortgage market meltdown. In 2010, we passed Dodd-Frank legislation. Going back to the Great Depression, the security Act and deposit insurance corporations were created after that. History tells us that we\u2019re not seeing any meaningful changes until the bubble of crypto bursts. One of the reasons is the political economy. Currently, many people are making a lot of money in crypto. It is hard to be the one that tries to take the punch ball away at the party. People like me, voices like mine, are being marginalized. Another reason is that we have a very fragmented regulatory structure in the US, and no one would create a financial system like ours from scratch, which is a historical byproduct. In the US, we have separate derivatives regulators from securities regulators. Therefore, derivatives are regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), and securities are regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In most other countries, those two functions are within one agency. As for cryptocurrencies, CFTC has defined bitcoin, ether, and by extension most other cryptocurrencies to be commodities. However, they do not typically regulate those commodity spot markets. That has good reasons for other commodities. They only regulate the derivative markets. What that means is that exchanges like Coinbase, Gemini, FTX, you name it, are unregulated on the federal level. Nevertheless, no one would suggest that it\u2019s a good idea for the New York Stock Exchange or the NASDAQ to be unregulated. That\u2019s exactly the type of situation we have regarding cryptocurrency exchanges. And that is completely untenable to me. There is no market, no rules, and no consumer protection rules. All the things that we use in traditional securities markets do not exist for cryptocurrency. There is a string in the crypto community that recognizes this as a gap. If you are aiming for the long term, you need investors to feel comfortable investing in an asset class like this. This is a point SEC Chair Gary Gensler has made a number of times. One reason why the U.S. has the largest financial market in the world is that investors take trust in investing in these listed companies because of regulation, so they have legal recourse if something goes wrong. Therefore, the law allows consumers to trust, which makes them more willing to invest, so the markets grow. I think that\u2019s ultimately what needs to happen with crypto. I know this idea goes against the libertarian ethos lying under the creation of cryptocurrencies. It is these principles that sustain Bitcoin in these years. There is tension there. But, there needs to be a change in the regulatory structure. A natural starting point is regulating these platforms, where the buying and selling of crypto occurs. There are many within the crypto market who want the CFTC to do it, but CFTC did not act much. The chair of CFTC, Chris Giancarlo, was nicknamed \u201ccrypto dad\u201d. The inverse comes to the SEC, and I think the SEC is the agency that should be given exclusive authority over these crypto trading platforms. I think that\u2019s where the debate lives now. It will change in the future. It is just a matter of when. Relevant Materials [1] The Greater Fool Theory \u25a0 What is The Greater Fool Theory? The Greater Fool Theory is the idea that, during a market bubble, one can make money by buying overvalued assets and selling them for a pro\ufb01t later, because it will always be possible to \ufb01nd someone who is willing to pay a higher price. An investor who subscribes to the Greater Fool Theory will buy potentially overvalued assets without any regard for their fundamental value. This speculative approach is predicated on the belief that you can make money by gambling on future asset prices and that you will always be able to \ufb01nd a \u201cgreater fool\u201d who will be willing to pay more than you did. Unfortunately, when the bubble eventually bursts (which it always does), there is a large sell-o\ufb00 that causes a rapid decline in the asset values. During the sell-o\ufb00, you can lose a great deal of money if you are the one left holding the asset and cannot \ufb01nd a buyer. \u25a0 Key Takeaways The Greater Fool Theory is a very risky, speculative strategy that is not recommended for long-term investors. [Website] [2] Crypto Market: \u25a0 Key Takeaways A cryptocurrency, broadly defined, is a form of digital tokens or \u201ccoins\u201d that exist on a distributed and decentralized ledger called a blockchain. Beyond that, the field of cryptocurrencies has expanded dramatically since Bitcoin was launched over a decade ago, and the next great digital token may be released tomorrow. Bitcoin continues to lead the pack of cryptocurrencies in terms of market capitalization, user base, and popularity. Other virtual currencies such as Ethereum are helping to create decentralized financial (DeFi) systems. Some altcoins have been endorsed as having newer features than Bitcoin, such as the ability to handle more transactions per second or use different consensus algorithms such as proof of stake. [Yahoo Finance] [Website] [3] Great Depression: \u25a0 What is Great Depression? The Great Depression was a severe worldwide economic depression that took place mostly during the 1930s, beginning in the United States. The timing of the Great Depression varied around the world; in most countries, it started in 1929 and lasted until the late 1930s. It was the longest, deepest, and most widespread depression of the 20th century. The Great Depression is commonly used as an example of how intensely the global economy can decline.

We have been living in an extraordinary period of low interest rates that has compelled us to search for yield assets, including stocks, cryptos, NFTs. I find it funny when the Federal Reserve notes they\u2019re going to raise interest rates, crypto goes down as if somehow they\u2019re related. But that\u2019s how the market is reacting. I do think NFT has a chance of staying permanently, but I also see a major correction coming very soon.","title":"Question 1"},{"location":"articles/AMA/BlockchainLawandEconomics/#question-2","text":"Zhitong: In your paper Bitcoin Futures: From Self-Certification to Systemic Risk , you discussed the systematic risk that could be brought by Bitcoin Futures . Can you elaborate on why you think so? More generally, we are eager to know whether you think the frenzy in the cryptocurrency market will bring systematic risk to the financial system. Mr. Reiners: That is a good question. It was not that long ago that we had the crypto market. The regular traditional financial system was not connecting the two. The interconnections were limited. It has completely changed, and one of the pivotal moments when it did change was in 2017. Bitcoin cash and futures contracts come to market. I was very critical of the decision and will discuss more crypto regulations. Derivatives and futures have their origins in agricultural markets. Farmers plant crops in the spring, and harvest and sell that crop in the fall. Since they are exposed to price risk, they might want to hedge that by signing a futures contract in the spring, guaranteeing to deliver a certain amount of green or corn at a certain price and a certain date. Speculators use derivative contracts and futures contracts. There are still genuine economic users and hedgers. However, the market looks quite different. They are cash-settled, and bitcoin is never exchanged at any point in these transactions. Say, William, I will sell you one bitcoin in one month, for $50,000. In one month, if the price of bitcoin rises to $55,000, then I can just give William $5,000. That is cash settle. This opens the bitcoin market to a new set of investors. Maybe they were worried about having custody of their private key right, or they didn\u2019t want to deal with a lightly-regulated exchange they were concerned with. But now, you can go to the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and buy a regulated futures contract. You never need to touch bitcoin and worry about those issues. It opens up the investor base, but it also creates new risks. Broadly speaking, when we talk about systemic risks, what are the features that create them? One is the overall size of the market. Again, crypto at this point is volatile, but it\u2019s still a 2 trillion market, which is much larger than it was in 2017. Another factor is leverage. We see increasing leverage in the crypto space offered by different exchanges. It\u2019s hard to get leverage in the US for various reasons, but many exchanges in Asia provide leverage. Then it\u2019s just how transparent the market is. With the light regulation, we have little visibility into space. When combining all the factors, it\u2019s clear that crypto could pose a systemic risk. While the market is still not big enough in that if Bitcoin and Ether go to zero tomorrow, I don\u2019t think an average person would feel it in any meaningful way. Nor do I think it would bring down a large financial institution. But as the crypto market evolves rapidly and continues to grow, it will pose a systemic risk very soon, and it will threaten financial stability. My background is a regulator at the New York Fed. If people want to gamble or speculate on worthless assets, that is fine. It is their issue. What I am worried about is the negative externalities. For example, what is going on in crypto could impact financial stability. We are seeing all the traditional financial intermediary functions play a role in crypto. The irony is that with all the premises on decentralization and bypassing intermediaries, the whole ecosystem is now filled with intermediaries and with the same type of concentration playing out. I think we should all be worried about the risks that are being created here.","title":"Question 2"},{"location":"articles/AMA/BlockchainLawandEconomics/#questions-3","text":"William: Prior to joining Duke Law, you worked for five years at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, first as a supervisor of systemically important financial institutions and then as a senior associate within the executive office. There must be a moment when you got the inspiration for blockchain and law-related topics from your past experience. How do you think this experience of financial regulation has contributed to your current career success? Also, we would like to learn more about your expectation for the future of fintech and blockchain, and your thoughts regarding the impacts of the emergence of cryptocurrencies on market regulations in the future. Mr. Reiners: Where you stand depends on where you sit. My views on cryptocurrency are informed by the work I did at the New York FED and others\u2019 life experiences, just as anyone\u2019s view is informed by their life experiences. However, the real pivotal moment in my professional career was in 2008, the global financial crisis, when the U.S. financial system essentially melted down. Later, I have spent my professional career studying and understanding and trying to prevent it. So I see so many parallels with what transpired leading up to 2008 in crypto. It starts with innovation. This innovation is going to solve some problems. In 2008, it was derivatives, mortgage-backed securities, and default swaps. It made credit more accessible. It was going to promote homeownership and all these wonderful things. And there\u2019s no downside, so it doesn\u2019t need to be regulated, right? You see the exact same thing play out now. Blockchain bypasses intermediary, it\u2019s fully transparent, there\u2019s no downside, this is the innovation, this is the future, so don\u2019t get in the way. We\u2019ve heard this before. However, the collective memories are short. Unregulated financial innovation can do serious damage to our economy. Social and political issues further give rise to welfare inequality that we are all concerned about now. For middle-income and low-income folks, houses were their biggest investment when housing prices fell after 2008. However, wealthy people hold a higher percentage of their wealth in the stock market, and stock prices recovered relatively more quickly. This exacerbated wealth inequality and led to the rise of extremist politicians. People like Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump emerged as a result. There are all sorts of unintended consequences. What does the future of crypto regulation look like? I am a bit pessimistic at this point, to be honest with you. When looking at the history of financial law in the U.S., it generally occurs in the wake of some type of crisis. In 2008, we had the mortgage market meltdown. In 2010, we passed Dodd-Frank legislation. Going back to the Great Depression, the security Act and deposit insurance corporations were created after that. History tells us that we\u2019re not seeing any meaningful changes until the bubble of crypto bursts. One of the reasons is the political economy. Currently, many people are making a lot of money in crypto. It is hard to be the one that tries to take the punch ball away at the party. People like me, voices like mine, are being marginalized. Another reason is that we have a very fragmented regulatory structure in the US, and no one would create a financial system like ours from scratch, which is a historical byproduct. In the US, we have separate derivatives regulators from securities regulators. Therefore, derivatives are regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), and securities are regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In most other countries, those two functions are within one agency. As for cryptocurrencies, CFTC has defined bitcoin, ether, and by extension most other cryptocurrencies to be commodities. However, they do not typically regulate those commodity spot markets. That has good reasons for other commodities. They only regulate the derivative markets. What that means is that exchanges like Coinbase, Gemini, FTX, you name it, are unregulated on the federal level. Nevertheless, no one would suggest that it\u2019s a good idea for the New York Stock Exchange or the NASDAQ to be unregulated. That\u2019s exactly the type of situation we have regarding cryptocurrency exchanges. And that is completely untenable to me. There is no market, no rules, and no consumer protection rules. All the things that we use in traditional securities markets do not exist for cryptocurrency. There is a string in the crypto community that recognizes this as a gap. If you are aiming for the long term, you need investors to feel comfortable investing in an asset class like this. This is a point SEC Chair Gary Gensler has made a number of times. One reason why the U.S. has the largest financial market in the world is that investors take trust in investing in these listed companies because of regulation, so they have legal recourse if something goes wrong. Therefore, the law allows consumers to trust, which makes them more willing to invest, so the markets grow. I think that\u2019s ultimately what needs to happen with crypto. I know this idea goes against the libertarian ethos lying under the creation of cryptocurrencies. It is these principles that sustain Bitcoin in these years. There is tension there. But, there needs to be a change in the regulatory structure. A natural starting point is regulating these platforms, where the buying and selling of crypto occurs. There are many within the crypto market who want the CFTC to do it, but CFTC did not act much. The chair of CFTC, Chris Giancarlo, was nicknamed \u201ccrypto dad\u201d. The inverse comes to the SEC, and I think the SEC is the agency that should be given exclusive authority over these crypto trading platforms. I think that\u2019s where the debate lives now. It will change in the future. It is just a matter of when.","title":"Questions 3"},{"location":"articles/AMA/BlockchainLawandEconomics/#relevant-materials","text":"[1] The Greater Fool Theory \u25a0 What is The Greater Fool Theory?

Questions 1 Johnny: Duke University is one of the first universities in the United States to offer a FinTech Master\u2019s Program through an Engineering School. What inspires you to find the fintech program? Studying fintech requires finance and technical skills. How do you prepare students with essential skills for the fintech industry? The program collaborates with the industry and government agencies, most recently with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) [1] . How do students benefit from the collaborations? What innovation could the partnerships create? Where do you envision the students in the program to be in ten years? Prof. Lenz: Having experience in both a business school and in industry, I see the value in applied skills I have been in the financial industry for a long time. I started off as a trader trading equities and derivatives, and then moved into the electronic trading and the algorithmic space. I really appreciate the part technology plays in finance, and it is becoming more and more so every day. I taught in a business school and hold my doctorate from a business school. When we started thinking about this program several years ago, I knew how business schools worked. They typically take a more theoretical in business school, whereas in an engineering school, things are more applied. The world today does not appreciate the theoretical side quite as much as it appreciates the applied side. I just thought it was a better place for fintech students to learn about fintech and to learn the applied skills employers are looking for. That was kind of the impetus for the program we have designed at Duke. All the folks that have helped put the program together and designed the courses were on the same page that everything should be very oriented towards applied skills, not so much the theoretical skills. Figure 2: Duke Pratt Engineering This was where this whole thing came about, and I think it worked out really well having it in an engineering school. We are one of the few engineering schools in the world that have graduate degrees in fintech, there are only a couple in the United States. But I know there are probably at least three other schools that are trying to start a program like this. We listen to the industry and students because we are in the most dynamic industries there is Attempting to start a FinTech program is attracting the right type of professors for what we are teaching. One of the things that I look for is professors who have real industry experience as well as great academic credentials. That is a hard thing to find because most people with really good academic credentials and who are working in the industry are making a lot of money, that has been challenging. We have been really lucky that we have a lot of professors who are still working in the industry. This has allowed us to have been able to do some really interesting things in the fintech space and here in the engineering school because of the great professors who are teaching in the program. When designing the program and changing it we rely on two things. First, we rely on the industry partnerships that we have formed. We have a lot of people in the industry actually teaching, and I still maintain a lot of my relationships in the industry. I talk to people all the time about different things that are going on in the program and how they fit into current and anticipated needs. Second, we rely on students, our students are incredibly smart and cognizant of things going on in the different areas of FinTech. Even though the program is only a few years old, we have already expanded the courses that we are offering due to the input received. For example, we had a number of students who were really interested in quantitative risk management. This spring, we are offering a course in quantitative risk management taught by somebody who has been doing this for about 20 years at some of the largest asset management companies in the country. This will be a great new course that will leverage other learning that students gain in the program. We had students that wanted to do a little bit more in the algorithmic trading space. This semester, we expanded the basic course and are offering a second advanced course in algorithmic trading. This spring, I will teach a basic blockchain course, it is an entry-level blockchain course. Next fall, we\u2019re hoping to have an advanced blockchain class that goes a little bit more into smart contracts and solidity coding. Figure 3: Blockchain We are very reflective of what students are telling us, and what industry is telling us. We are in probably the most dynamic industry in the world, and our courses have to reflect that. We will add new courses and will take courses away very quickly, much more quickly than in some of the other disciplines. What we are teaching changes every day. Partnerships lead to real-world experience and the applied nature of education Partnerships give me an opportunity to see what the industry wants to do. They allow us to look at things and hear what is going on right now. I meet with people that are working for all types of FinTech companies and companies employing FinTech solutions at least once a week and I also meet with government agencies. The FDIC is a perfect example. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp is probably the largest insurer of banks in the world. They announced a partnership with the Duke cybersecurity program and the fintech program last year. It benefits the students in a couple of different ways. We get access to people that have an extraordinary experience. Sultan Meghji , who is the deputy director of the FDIC and the head of innovation, spoke at the program seminar just a couple of weeks ago. Even better is they sponsored three internship programs this summer, all of which employed multiple students. Students were able to interact with people at the FDIC, work on problems that they are interested in solving, and work with people who are senior researchers and people that are looking at the banking industry at the FDIC. I think those kinds of partnerships are invaluable because the knowledge that students pick up is not only technical but also the experience of working in a business environment and that\u2019s really important. Figure 4: Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation When you enroll in your first job, understanding certain things about working in a business is really important. In finance, government agencies are particularly involved, and this is around the world, not just in the US. I do think that this is an area of experience that is extremely valuable if you go into the industry, because you have to be able to work with regulators. You should understand what they are asking for, how you can interact with them, I think it is really important that students have this kind of working exposure to regulators. We also partner with a number of private companies, all of the FinTech students had internships. These opportunities are giving students real-world experience in working on cutting-edge problems and new developments that are occurring right now. They are solving for those, and I think these experiences are where they can see the applied nature of their education, which is much more important than the theoretical approach to things. Questions 2 Ray: DeFi offers a lot of new opportunities and could solve the problems of centralized financial systems. It improves efficiency and allows equal treatment of customers. An Economist article ( \u201cInvestment in fintech booms as upstarts go mainstream\u201d published online on July 12th, 2021 ) wrote that one in every five dollars invested by venture capital this year has gone into fintech. DeFi\u2019s development has drawn so much attention and hype. You mentioned in class that the usage of DeFi is just being scratched, it is only the start. What are some of the most exciting usages of DeFi that you have seen, and what kind of problems do they solve? What is the primary advantage of DeFi over traditional finance? What are the challenges of DeFi, and how do you think it would further develop? Prof. Lenz: Reinventing finance and expanding the possibilities: DeFi solves various problems DeFi is such a big space, I feel like we are reinventing banking and finance with DeFi. Almost as if we are kind of going back and starting over again. I think DeFi solves a lot of problems. One of them is the idea of equal treatment: I mentioned this term a lot when I talk about DeFi. Currently, retail investors have not been treated well at all in finance and I think it is only getting worse. However, DeFi provides retail investors with products that they couldn\u2019t get otherwise. For instance, if I want to do a swap, I can\u2019t do that as a retail investor. But I am able to do that with DeFi because there are a lot of products that provide this type of opportunity now available. However, DeFi is still hard to use right now, consider its complicated nature and things like the user interfaces, I don\u2019t think many people can invest money in DeFi right now. The other thing I think about DeFi is that it is expanding a lot of things. Not only is it offering a lot of different products, but it is offering them to people around the world , which I think is a really good thing. Because it operates in a virtual space, it\u2019s very different in that regard. Figure 5: DeFi expands a lot of things Business with less friction: A case of DeFi application in mortgage securitization Besides, there are some interesting things from the institutional side. I mentioned Mike Cagney \u2019s speaking at our FinTech seminar a couple of weeks ago. he started a company called Provenance . And what provenance does is securitizing mortgages on the blockchain. Similar to how mortgages are packaged, securitized, and sold in capital markets today, Mike is doing that on the blockchain. But, and this is really important, he is taking 100 basis points out of the cost. So, when you mentioned efficiency, that is 100 basis points in a really low interest rate environment that he has been taking out of the cost by using blockchain. So, he has actually proved that you can take a lot of friction out by using blockchain. He has been able to do that with a pretty old product, but he is doing it in a very new way. The people who are selling and buying the mortgages (e.g., big banks) are exactly the same, but they\u2019re doing it in a very different way, which is much more efficient and can allow for better rates and other opportunities. As I previously mentioned, I think access is one of the biggest things that DeFi offers. DeFi provides access to people who do not have access to certain products, and I think that is really important. In the traditional financial space, things are actually contracting but not expanding. So, when they are making more ETFs and things like that, they are just slicing the same assets more and more times. Consider for a minute that the actual number of stocks available to retail investors, if you look at the number of stocks listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Is it going up or going down every year for the last decade? We have less than half of the stocks publicly traded now as we had a decade ago. So, there are fewer and fewer equities people can invest in. When people want to invest in the next Google, next Apple, or new whatever, you are not able, because it likely went to private equity and you are never going to get a chance to participate in that. DeFi offers the opportunity to provide the retail public with the type ability to participate in some investment opportunities that don\u2019t exist anywhere else, and I think that is really important. Figure 6: Number and Market Cap of U.S. Listed Companies [Source: Ernst & Young, The World Bank (World Development Indicators)] DeFi is young and not perfect, we are committed to engage and inform more people However, DeFi is not perfect, there are some problems. For example, the user interfaces are often not very user friendly, to say the least DeFi is still very nascent in that respect, but it is also very young, and these things take time. There are also problems with understanding, an example is the issues many people are familiar with concerning private keys: people lose those private keys all the time. You guys probably all know somebody who has lost their private keys, the fact that we do not have central custodians like a bank makes it difficult. Yet people from different geographic areas are trying to do things but there are not really any regulations, but contrary to popular belief, I do believe we need some guardrails up there, not a lot, but I think we need some. There are other issues with DeFi like the lack of educational materials and disclosures. There is little to no documentation for a lot of different products. Products are often being sold to people who already have a good understanding; however, I believe more documentation is better to expand the number of knowledgeable users. We want people to understand and write about this, as well as to do more research into this space. More research, documentation, and disclosures will likely uncover products that have a very low probability to succeed and people do not understand that. Questions 3 Johnny: The total DeFi token market cap is over 137 billion USD as of 9/1/2021 on CoinmarketCap . Regulators and Central banks are concerned about the impact of DeFi on monetary policy as people lock more and more money in the DeFi market. Based on past conversations, you seem not supportive of strict regulations on DeFi. Then, how do you think government regulators should perform their role in the DeFi ecosystem for Social Good? Prof. Lenz: Government regulators should learn before regulating With regard to DeFi, in particular, cryptocurrency, I would highly encourage legislators to learn about it before regulating it. I think there is a huge lack of knowledge and understanding of what DeFi is, which is understandable given its maturity. The nature of DeFi is very different than traditional investments, for example, if you are here in the US and you quote numbers about assets or users or whatever, people assume these are all from the US. If you are in Germany, they think these are all from Germany. If you are in Japan, they think these are all from Japan. Every country thinks like this. They forget that this takes place in a virtual environment, this is a concept that is often really difficult for people to understand. But things are changing, a good example would be the big infrastructure bill in the US. It was held up for three days around the cryptocurrencies and how they would be taxed. Much of the debate illustrated a lack of understanding. In the end, it was written very broadly. There is an additional area of government concern for central banks, the currency. They can buy and sell yuan, dollars, euros, or whatever currencies, and that is the way they control rates. All of a sudden, if you have this other environment that takes a lot of that control away from them, this is certainly going to raise some serious questions. Central bank digital currencies are intriguing I am very interested to see how central bank digital currencies (CBDC) [2] start to mature. I think what is going on in China right now with the experiments is very interesting. I like the idea of using the central bank\u2019s digital currency to propagate policy decisions. I think they have done a couple of really interesting things. Instead of giving people money, they are giving rebates when people buy things. When governments provide individuals with money, it is to encourage them to go out and spend the money, so the money gets into the local economies. But if the funds go instead into savings accounts, this does not achieve the desired results. The idea of using CBDC to incentivize spending has been achieved through the use of immediate rebates. When you go out a new microwave, for example, you immediately receive a 30% rebate back in CBDC in your wallet, (which makes you more likely to buy it), and that is the way to spur on local economies. I love this kind of idea. Figure 7: Central Bank Digital Currency It is much more efficient than not sending out paper checks. Even in places like Brazil and India, are providing alternatives to paper checks, they are utilizing support payments in electronic form rather than in paper check form. Electronic payments remove some of the frictions when utilized correctly which can support policy in the marketplace. People receive their funds in a much shorter period of time, and this has the added benefit of cutting down on checks getting lost or stolen and may reduce fraud.

I started off as a trader trading equities and derivatives, and then moved into the electronic trading and the algorithmic space. I really appreciate the part technology plays in finance, and it is becoming more and more so every day. I taught in a business school and hold my doctorate from a business school. When we started thinking about this program several years ago, I knew how business schools worked. They typically take a more theoretical in business school, whereas in an engineering school, things are more applied. The world today does not appreciate the theoretical side quite as much as it appreciates the applied side. I just thought it was a better place for fintech students to learn about fintech and to learn the applied skills employers are looking for. That was kind of the impetus for the program we have designed at Duke. All the folks that have helped put the program together and designed the courses were on the same page that everything should be very oriented towards applied skills, not so much the theoretical skills. Figure 2: Duke Pratt Engineering This was where this whole thing came about, and I think it worked out really well having it in an engineering school. We are one of the few engineering schools in the world that have graduate degrees in fintech, there are only a couple in the United States. But I know there are probably at least three other schools that are trying to start a program like this. We listen to the industry and students because we are in the most dynamic industries there is Attempting to start a FinTech program is attracting the right type of professors for what we are teaching. One of the things that I look for is professors who have real industry experience as well as great academic credentials. That is a hard thing to find because most people with really good academic credentials and who are working in the industry are making a lot of money, that has been challenging. We have been really lucky that we have a lot of professors who are still working in the industry. This has allowed us to have been able to do some really interesting things in the fintech space and here in the engineering school because of the great professors who are teaching in the program. When designing the program and changing it we rely on two things. First, we rely on the industry partnerships that we have formed. We have a lot of people in the industry actually teaching, and I still maintain a lot of my relationships in the industry. I talk to people all the time about different things that are going on in the program and how they fit into current and anticipated needs. Second, we rely on students, our students are incredibly smart and cognizant of things going on in the different areas of FinTech. Even though the program is only a few years old, we have already expanded the courses that we are offering due to the input received. For example, we had a number of students who were really interested in quantitative risk management. This spring, we are offering a course in quantitative risk management taught by somebody who has been doing this for about 20 years at some of the largest asset management companies in the country. This will be a great new course that will leverage other learning that students gain in the program. We had students that wanted to do a little bit more in the algorithmic trading space. This semester, we expanded the basic course and are offering a second advanced course in algorithmic trading. This spring, I will teach a basic blockchain course, it is an entry-level blockchain course. Next fall, we\u2019re hoping to have an advanced blockchain class that goes a little bit more into smart contracts and solidity coding. Figure 3: Blockchain We are very reflective of what students are telling us, and what industry is telling us. We are in probably the most dynamic industry in the world, and our courses have to reflect that. We will add new courses and will take courses away very quickly, much more quickly than in some of the other disciplines. What we are teaching changes every day. Partnerships lead to real-world experience and the applied nature of education Partnerships give me an opportunity to see what the industry wants to do. They allow us to look at things and hear what is going on right now. I meet with people that are working for all types of FinTech companies and companies employing FinTech solutions at least once a week and I also meet with government agencies. The FDIC is a perfect example. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp is probably the largest insurer of banks in the world. They announced a partnership with the Duke cybersecurity program and the fintech program last year. It benefits the students in a couple of different ways. We get access to people that have an extraordinary experience. Sultan Meghji , who is the deputy director of the FDIC and the head of innovation, spoke at the program seminar just a couple of weeks ago. Even better is they sponsored three internship programs this summer, all of which employed multiple students. Students were able to interact with people at the FDIC, work on problems that they are interested in solving, and work with people who are senior researchers and people that are looking at the banking industry at the FDIC. I think those kinds of partnerships are invaluable because the knowledge that students pick up is not only technical but also the experience of working in a business environment and that\u2019s really important. Figure 4: Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation When you enroll in your first job, understanding certain things about working in a business is really important. In finance, government agencies are particularly involved, and this is around the world, not just in the US. I do think that this is an area of experience that is extremely valuable if you go into the industry, because you have to be able to work with regulators. You should understand what they are asking for, how you can interact with them, I think it is really important that students have this kind of working exposure to regulators. We also partner with a number of private companies, all of the FinTech students had internships. These opportunities are giving students real-world experience in working on cutting-edge problems and new developments that are occurring right now. They are solving for those, and I think these experiences are where they can see the applied nature of their education, which is much more important than the theoretical approach to things.","title":"Having experience in both a business school and in industry, I see the value in applied skills"},{"location":"articles/AMA/DeFi%3AReinventingFinanceandExpandingthePossibilities/#questions-2","text":"Ray: DeFi offers a lot of new opportunities and could solve the problems of centralized financial systems. It improves efficiency and allows equal treatment of customers. An Economist article ( \u201cInvestment in fintech booms as upstarts go mainstream\u201d published online on July 12th, 2021 ) wrote that one in every five dollars invested by venture capital this year has gone into fintech. DeFi\u2019s development has drawn so much attention and hype. You mentioned in class that the usage of DeFi is just being scratched, it is only the start. What are some of the most exciting usages of DeFi that you have seen, and what kind of problems do they solve? What is the primary advantage of DeFi over traditional finance? What are the challenges of DeFi, and how do you think it would further develop? Prof. Lenz: Reinventing finance and expanding the possibilities: DeFi solves various problems DeFi is such a big space, I feel like we are reinventing banking and finance with DeFi. Almost as if we are kind of going back and starting over again. I think DeFi solves a lot of problems. One of them is the idea of equal treatment: I mentioned this term a lot when I talk about DeFi. Currently, retail investors have not been treated well at all in finance and I think it is only getting worse. However, DeFi provides retail investors with products that they couldn\u2019t get otherwise. For instance, if I want to do a swap, I can\u2019t do that as a retail investor. But I am able to do that with DeFi because there are a lot of products that provide this type of opportunity now available. However, DeFi is still hard to use right now, consider its complicated nature and things like the user interfaces, I don\u2019t think many people can invest money in DeFi right now. The other thing I think about DeFi is that it is expanding a lot of things. Not only is it offering a lot of different products, but it is offering them to people around the world , which I think is a really good thing. Because it operates in a virtual space, it\u2019s very different in that regard. Figure 5: DeFi expands a lot of things Business with less friction: A case of DeFi application in mortgage securitization Besides, there are some interesting things from the institutional side. I mentioned Mike Cagney \u2019s speaking at our FinTech seminar a couple of weeks ago. he started a company called Provenance . And what provenance does is securitizing mortgages on the blockchain. Similar to how mortgages are packaged, securitized, and sold in capital markets today, Mike is doing that on the blockchain. But, and this is really important, he is taking 100 basis points out of the cost. So, when you mentioned efficiency, that is 100 basis points in a really low interest rate environment that he has been taking out of the cost by using blockchain. So, he has actually proved that you can take a lot of friction out by using blockchain. He has been able to do that with a pretty old product, but he is doing it in a very new way. The people who are selling and buying the mortgages (e.g., big banks) are exactly the same, but they\u2019re doing it in a very different way, which is much more efficient and can allow for better rates and other opportunities. As I previously mentioned, I think access is one of the biggest things that DeFi offers. DeFi provides access to people who do not have access to certain products, and I think that is really important. In the traditional financial space, things are actually contracting but not expanding. So, when they are making more ETFs and things like that, they are just slicing the same assets more and more times. Consider for a minute that the actual number of stocks available to retail investors, if you look at the number of stocks listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Is it going up or going down every year for the last decade? We have less than half of the stocks publicly traded now as we had a decade ago. So, there are fewer and fewer equities people can invest in. When people want to invest in the next Google, next Apple, or new whatever, you are not able, because it likely went to private equity and you are never going to get a chance to participate in that. DeFi offers the opportunity to provide the retail public with the type ability to participate in some investment opportunities that don\u2019t exist anywhere else, and I think that is really important. Figure 6: Number and Market Cap of U.S. Listed Companies [Source: Ernst & Young, The World Bank (World Development Indicators)] DeFi is young and not perfect, we are committed to engage and inform more people However, DeFi is not perfect, there are some problems. For example, the user interfaces are often not very user friendly, to say the least DeFi is still very nascent in that respect, but it is also very young, and these things take time. There are also problems with understanding, an example is the issues many people are familiar with concerning private keys: people lose those private keys all the time. You guys probably all know somebody who has lost their private keys, the fact that we do not have central custodians like a bank makes it difficult. Yet people from different geographic areas are trying to do things but there are not really any regulations, but contrary to popular belief, I do believe we need some guardrails up there, not a lot, but I think we need some. There are other issues with DeFi like the lack of educational materials and disclosures. There is little to no documentation for a lot of different products. Products are often being sold to people who already have a good understanding; however, I believe more documentation is better to expand the number of knowledgeable users. We want people to understand and write about this, as well as to do more research into this space. More research, documentation, and disclosures will likely uncover products that have a very low probability to succeed and people do not understand that.","title":"Questions 2"},{"location":"articles/AMA/DeFi%3AReinventingFinanceandExpandingthePossibilities/#questions-3","text":"Johnny: The total DeFi token market cap is over 137 billion USD as of 9/1/2021 on CoinmarketCap . Regulators and Central banks are concerned about the impact of DeFi on monetary policy as people lock more and more money in the DeFi market. Based on past conversations, you seem not supportive of strict regulations on DeFi. Then, how do you think government regulators should perform their role in the DeFi ecosystem for Social Good? Prof. Lenz: Government regulators should learn before regulating With regard to DeFi, in particular, cryptocurrency, I would highly encourage legislators to learn about it before regulating it. I think there is a huge lack of knowledge and understanding of what DeFi is, which is understandable given its maturity. The nature of DeFi is very different than traditional investments, for example, if you are here in the US and you quote numbers about assets or users or whatever, people assume these are all from the US. If you are in Germany, they think these are all from Germany. If you are in Japan, they think these are all from Japan. Every country thinks like this. They forget that this takes place in a virtual environment, this is a concept that is often really difficult for people to understand. But things are changing, a good example would be the big infrastructure bill in the US. It was held up for three days around the cryptocurrencies and how they would be taxed. Much of the debate illustrated a lack of understanding. In the end, it was written very broadly. There is an additional area of government concern for central banks, the currency. They can buy and sell yuan, dollars, euros, or whatever currencies, and that is the way they control rates. All of a sudden, if you have this other environment that takes a lot of that control away from them, this is certainly going to raise some serious questions. Central bank digital currencies are intriguing I am very interested to see how central bank digital currencies (CBDC) [2] start to mature. I think what is going on in China right now with the experiments is very interesting. I like the idea of using the central bank\u2019s digital currency to propagate policy decisions. I think they have done a couple of really interesting things. Instead of giving people money, they are giving rebates when people buy things. When governments provide individuals with money, it is to encourage them to go out and spend the money, so the money gets into the local economies. But if the funds go instead into savings accounts, this does not achieve the desired results. The idea of using CBDC to incentivize spending has been achieved through the use of immediate rebates. When you go out a new microwave, for example, you immediately receive a 30% rebate back in CBDC in your wallet, (which makes you more likely to buy it), and that is the way to spur on local economies. I love this kind of idea. Figure 7: Central Bank Digital Currency It is much more efficient than not sending out paper checks. Even in places like Brazil and India, are providing alternatives to paper checks, they are utilizing support payments in electronic form rather than in paper check form. Electronic payments remove some of the frictions when utilized correctly which can support policy in the marketplace. People receive their funds in a much shorter period of time, and this has the added benefit of cutting down on checks getting lost or stolen and may reduce fraud.","title":"Questions 3"},{"location":"articles/AMA/DeFi%3AReinventingFinanceandExpandingthePossibilities/#relevant-materials","text":"[1] Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) \u25cf What is FDIC?

He originally studied mechanical engineering and pursued a Ph.D. in the field of medical engineering. He\u2019s always been interested in novel applications and interdisciplinary fields, recently motivating him to enter the blockchain space. Currently, he\u2019s working as a Junior Analyst, researching blockchain applications with a focus on the Internet Computer Protocol. Watch our AMA interview for Dr. Dustin Becker on our YouTube channel , SciEcon. Read the Interview Scripts with annotations and references: Opening Remark Prof. Luyao Zhang: Today, we are very glad to have Dr. Dustin Becker here for our AMA interview. Dr. Dustin Becker recently joined Bochsler Finance, \u200b\u200bZ\u00fcrich Switzerland, after completing the postdoc at ETH Z\u00fcrich. Currently, he is working as a junior analyst researching blockchain applications, focusing on Internet Computer protocol (IPC). We are very much looking forward to hearing his insights on blockchain and Internet Computer. Today with me, we have Yufan and Zichao, who are the leaders for the SciEcon NFT Research Lab. Then let\u2019s start our interview. Questions 1 Zichao: We noticed that you focused on medical engineering for doctoral studies at ETH based on your LinkedIn profile. What interests you in the blockchain world, and what motivates you to become an analyst at Bochsler Finance Solution and a Researcher at ICP Global Fund ? Dr. Dustin Becker: I really enjoy working in this cutting-edge kind of field where you have no inhibitions taking place. As you already said, I just very recently actually entered into the blockchain space \u2014 it must have already been at the beginning of November. Therefore, everything is also pretty new for me, and very exciting so far. Figure 2: Blockchain and NFT In fact, before entering full-time into blockchain and starting at Bochsler Finance, I was already following along the blockchain space for a couple of years. Thus, it\u2019s not entirely new for me, but I\u2019ve been doing it mainly on a hobby- and investment-side, following along with what\u2019s been going on. When I finished my Ph.D. and was working as a postdoc, I had been thinking a lot about what I wanted to do and how I wanted to continue my career. I realized that I really enjoy working in this cutting-edge kind of field where you have no inhibitions taking place. I have enough interest in the blockchain personally, and this field could be my possible career paths. Therefore, I ended up finding the advertisement for this job application. Somehow I ended up here \u2014 I never expected this, but this is a great opportunity. So far, I am quite enjoying it. It\u2019s a very interesting field and an exciting work environment to be in. Questions 2 Yufan: After many years of rapid growth in the blockchain industry, NFTs rose rapidly at the beginning of this year. As a junior analyst at Bochsler Finance, which is an asset manager specializing in the blockchain industry and decentralized finance, what do you think about the current NFT market in terms of the most significant flaws and weaknesses and its possible future development? Dustin: While the boom of NFT has a lot of opportunities, it also always brings along fraudsters. The NFT marketplace right now is quite similar to the ICO boom four years ago, where you had a lot of different projects coming up with a lot of ideas. Many ideas and projects were great but a lot were also not very well-founded, and people just popped up websites trying to get funding for the ICO, and then never delivered on their promises. This is also the risk right now within the whole NFT market, which is booming and hype right now. It has a lot of very cool possible applications and a lot of opportunities while this also always brings along fraudsters, who try to take advantage of this. This is certainly a significant risk of NFT. People have to know what kind of projects they are getting into, and the risk of falling for certain fraud exists. Moreover, when getting an NFT, it is not easy to know whether you\u2019re not buying a counterfeit copy or an original one. This is certainly a risk, but luckily there are also solutions to this, at least for certain aspects. For example, Origyn , which is also developed on the IC layer, is going to do the KYC of the customers and the artist. Therefore, it can actually prove who you are as a person, which can also reduce the risks of people misusing the system. I think it always has pros and cons, but this is a way to approach this. Figure 3: NFT Authenticity It is an ongoing debate on the topic of regulation on cryptocurrency. Other risks with NFTs like money-laundering make it very easy for people to misuse the whole system. For example, suppose you have set up two accounts, you can buy an NFT cheaply, and then buy it from yourself for a much larger amount. You can just say that this is how I earned this money. This situation is certainly an aspect that is also quite risky. These stories come up, and it always puts a bad light on the blockchain, cryptocurrency, and NFT space. Therefore, NFT certainly also needs some form of regulations and a possible solution to this is KYC. The whole topic of regulation is very tricky right now in cryptocurrency because there\u2019s not much regulation in place yet \u2014 it\u2019s an ongoing debate. For example, the US congress is continuously discussing on how to regulate blockchain and cryptocurrencies.There\u2019s certainly some regulation needed in the future and we will see where this will takeus, but this will also bring more certainty and reduce the risks for the whole NFT space in the future. Zichao: What do you think about the marketplace\u2019s popularity now? Do you think the rapid growth of the NFT market will keep going? If so, for how long? Dr. Dustin: If I knew this, then I could make a lot of money, but I guess nobody knows. It\u2019s a hype and a big boom right now, which certainly will not go on like this forever. There will be a correction at some point or maybe it goes on for a lot longer. Like I said, I just recently started and I\u2019m certainly no expert. I also don\u2019t have a crystal ball where I can look into the future. Questions 3 Zichao: Besides Ethereum \u2014 the birthplace of NFT, many other blockchains also built NFT functions. For example, Polygon , Flow , Binance Smart Chain , Tron , etc. What do you think are the pros and cons of developing NFT on various blockchains, especially compared to the developer experience, efficiency, scalability, and security on the Internet Computer? Dr. Dustin: A big problem that some of the blockchains have is scalability. I have limited experience developing on any blockchain really. From my understanding, so far, it\u2019s really a big problem that some of the blockchains have is simply the scalability. Many blockchains are trying to solve this, especially with the immense gas fees of Ethereum. However, I haven\u2019t developed on these other blockchains. Currently, I\u2019m learning a bit of Motoko on the Internet Computer but I don\u2019t know about the specifics of the other blockchains. However, the big difference that I see, especially so far with developing NFTs on the Internet Computer compared to other ones, is where the asset of the NFTs is actually stored. One part of all the other NFT marketplaces on the other chains, at least what I saw so far, is that the asset itself of an NFT is stored on the classical web and on multiple web services, or IPFS services . You want to have complete Web3.0 applications instead of compromising on storing certain parts of it on the classical web and then having only the NFT metadata identified basically on the blockchain. It is essential to have everything decentralized. Figure 4: Motoko Programming Language Internet Computer gives you the advantages of removing the dependency on other platforms and hosting the entire application on the blockchain The big advantage with ICP is that you can actually have everything on the Internet Computer itself. In other words, there is no need for other platforms because the Internet Computer has the capability of storing the whole asset in certain canisters. Also, the fact that you can actually have the full application, including the front-end hosting on the Internet Computer, is a big difference compared to the other platforms and blockchains. I haven\u2019t seen another blockchain where you can actually host the entire application on the blockchain so far. One actually has to have the front-end in the classical web or some in-web services. Therefore, this is a huge advantage of the Internet Computer regarding scalability and security because everything is decentralized in the end. Regarding developer experience, Dfinity is trying to make it simple for developers because they\u2019re introducing their own language Motoko . Additionally, having the ability to program or develop in Rust makes it quite convenient for new developers to onboard. With me learning Motoko right now, it\u2019s quite interesting. It\u2019s a different type of language for me to learn, but so far, I find it\u2019s very intuitive. Many developers are also working on making tools to make developers\u2019 experience on IC more efficient and more convenient. Many tools will come up in the future and a whole ecosystem will evolve in the next couple of months and years. Questions 4 Yufan: Having a sustainable business model that benefits all stakeholders is the guarantee for the long-term popularity of the blockchain ecosystem. Developers are an essential component of stakeholders in the blockchain ecosystem. How does the current business model in the NFT ecosystem benefit developers, and what are your thoughts on the current limitations and future development? Dr. Dustin: The NFT royalties give developers an incentive as a long-term revenue stream. I think you can group this into two parts, especially regarding NFTs. Developers can also be the creators of these NFTs because the NFTs can be artistic work, like classical artists\u2019 work. There\u2019s also a lot of digital artwork created by software developers or applications that can also be an NFT. A big benefit, of course, here is the concept of royalties. When you are a creator or developer developing some sort of NFT, which gets into the secondary market, there is a long-term revenue stream for these developers. Thus, this is really an incentive also for developers or creators to create their creative new types of NFTs. Figure 5: An Example of DAO: SharkDAO Having DAO structures gives every developer, no matter what kind of hierarchy, a voice in the end. Another benefit for developers working on ICP or other applications is basically that you have the tokenization of these various applications and Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAO) [1]\u2019s forming around these. You then have a direct stake or share of the application you\u2019re developing. Therefore, if you\u2019re a motivated and creative developer, you can put in a lot of effort to develop a nice platform and as you have a personal stake in it, you have a personal incentive for it to become successful. Also, the fact of having these DAO formations, in the end, gives every developer, no matter what kind of hierarchy, a voice. Let\u2019s take the example of NNS (Network Nervous System) [2] on the Internet Computer that everybody can bring up proposals on how to improve the whole ecosystem. In that case, you won\u2019t have to climb up the ladder in hierarchy, as in certain classical businesses, to bring up your ideas and proposals. Everyone can simply post the proposal to the forum or the NNS. This is really a remodeling of every developer and every person involved in the ecosystem. They can bring up ideas and have a voice, which is a huge benefit and something that differentiates from classical business structures. Relevant Materials [1] Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAO) What is DAO? A DAO is an organization run by a group of people with no typical company hierarchy, who establish their own rules and make decisions based on smart contracts on a blockchain. All its rules and transactions are recorded on the blockchain, thereby removing the need for any central entity. How does DAO relate to NFTs? DAOs help the NFT industry by collective ownership of an asset. Another key area where DAOs help NFTs is community governance. [2] Network Nervous System (NNS) What is NNS? The Network Nervous System (NNS) is the open algorithmic system governing the Internet Computer blockchain. Its most notable innovations include its ability to upgrade the Internet Computer protocol and software running on node machines, onboard new node providers, add node machines into the blockchain network, and create new subnet blockchains to increase capacity. How does NNS work? Anyone can participate in the NNS by staking ICP tokens into one or more neurons. Neurons can submit proposals and decide to adopt or reject them. The NNS implements liquid democracy: neurons can follow other neurons and delegate voting power.

What interests you in the blockchain world, and what motivates you to become an analyst at Bochsler Finance Solution and a Researcher at ICP Global Fund ? Dr. Dustin Becker: I really enjoy working in this cutting-edge kind of field where you have no inhibitions taking place. As you already said, I just very recently actually entered into the blockchain space \u2014 it must have already been at the beginning of November. Therefore, everything is also pretty new for me, and very exciting so far. Figure 2: Blockchain and NFT In fact, before entering full-time into blockchain and starting at Bochsler Finance, I was already following along the blockchain space for a couple of years. Thus, it\u2019s not entirely new for me, but I\u2019ve been doing it mainly on a hobby- and investment-side, following along with what\u2019s been going on. When I finished my Ph.D. and was working as a postdoc, I had been thinking a lot about what I wanted to do and how I wanted to continue my career. I realized that I really enjoy working in this cutting-edge kind of field where you have no inhibitions taking place. I have enough interest in the blockchain personally, and this field could be my possible career paths. Therefore, I ended up finding the advertisement for this job application. Somehow I ended up here \u2014 I never expected this, but this is a great opportunity. So far, I am quite enjoying it. It\u2019s a very interesting field and an exciting work environment to be in.","title":"Questions 1"},{"location":"articles/AMA/DevelopmentStatusandFutureTrendsofEmergingNFTMarket/#questions-2","text":"Yufan: After many years of rapid growth in the blockchain industry, NFTs rose rapidly at the beginning of this year. As a junior analyst at Bochsler Finance, which is an asset manager specializing in the blockchain industry and decentralized finance, what do you think about the current NFT market in terms of the most significant flaws and weaknesses and its possible future development? Dustin: While the boom of NFT has a lot of opportunities, it also always brings along fraudsters. The NFT marketplace right now is quite similar to the ICO boom four years ago, where you had a lot of different projects coming up with a lot of ideas. Many ideas and projects were great but a lot were also not very well-founded, and people just popped up websites trying to get funding for the ICO, and then never delivered on their promises. This is also the risk right now within the whole NFT market, which is booming and hype right now. It has a lot of very cool possible applications and a lot of opportunities while this also always brings along fraudsters, who try to take advantage of this. This is certainly a significant risk of NFT. People have to know what kind of projects they are getting into, and the risk of falling for certain fraud exists. Moreover, when getting an NFT, it is not easy to know whether you\u2019re not buying a counterfeit copy or an original one. This is certainly a risk, but luckily there are also solutions to this, at least for certain aspects. For example, Origyn , which is also developed on the IC layer, is going to do the KYC of the customers and the artist. Therefore, it can actually prove who you are as a person, which can also reduce the risks of people misusing the system. I think it always has pros and cons, but this is a way to approach this. Figure 3: NFT Authenticity It is an ongoing debate on the topic of regulation on cryptocurrency. Other risks with NFTs like money-laundering make it very easy for people to misuse the whole system. For example, suppose you have set up two accounts, you can buy an NFT cheaply, and then buy it from yourself for a much larger amount. You can just say that this is how I earned this money. This situation is certainly an aspect that is also quite risky. These stories come up, and it always puts a bad light on the blockchain, cryptocurrency, and NFT space. Therefore, NFT certainly also needs some form of regulations and a possible solution to this is KYC. The whole topic of regulation is very tricky right now in cryptocurrency because there\u2019s not much regulation in place yet \u2014 it\u2019s an ongoing debate. For example, the US congress is continuously discussing on how to regulate blockchain and cryptocurrencies.There\u2019s certainly some regulation needed in the future and we will see where this will takeus, but this will also bring more certainty and reduce the risks for the whole NFT space in the future. Zichao: What do you think about the marketplace\u2019s popularity now? Do you think the rapid growth of the NFT market will keep going? If so, for how long? Dr. Dustin: If I knew this, then I could make a lot of money, but I guess nobody knows. It\u2019s a hype and a big boom right now, which certainly will not go on like this forever. There will be a correction at some point or maybe it goes on for a lot longer. Like I said, I just recently started and I\u2019m certainly no expert. I also don\u2019t have a crystal ball where I can look into the future.","title":"Questions 2"},{"location":"articles/AMA/DevelopmentStatusandFutureTrendsofEmergingNFTMarket/#questions-3","text":"Zichao: Besides Ethereum \u2014 the birthplace of NFT, many other blockchains also built NFT functions. For example, Polygon , Flow , Binance Smart Chain , Tron , etc. What do you think are the pros and cons of developing NFT on various blockchains, especially compared to the developer experience, efficiency, scalability, and security on the Internet Computer? Dr. Dustin: A big problem that some of the blockchains have is scalability. I have limited experience developing on any blockchain really. From my understanding, so far, it\u2019s really a big problem that some of the blockchains have is simply the scalability. Many blockchains are trying to solve this, especially with the immense gas fees of Ethereum. However, I haven\u2019t developed on these other blockchains. Currently, I\u2019m learning a bit of Motoko on the Internet Computer but I don\u2019t know about the specifics of the other blockchains. However, the big difference that I see, especially so far with developing NFTs on the Internet Computer compared to other ones, is where the asset of the NFTs is actually stored. One part of all the other NFT marketplaces on the other chains, at least what I saw so far, is that the asset itself of an NFT is stored on the classical web and on multiple web services, or IPFS services . You want to have complete Web3.0 applications instead of compromising on storing certain parts of it on the classical web and then having only the NFT metadata identified basically on the blockchain. It is essential to have everything decentralized. Figure 4: Motoko Programming Language Internet Computer gives you the advantages of removing the dependency on other platforms and hosting the entire application on the blockchain The big advantage with ICP is that you can actually have everything on the Internet Computer itself. In other words, there is no need for other platforms because the Internet Computer has the capability of storing the whole asset in certain canisters. Also, the fact that you can actually have the full application, including the front-end hosting on the Internet Computer, is a big difference compared to the other platforms and blockchains. I haven\u2019t seen another blockchain where you can actually host the entire application on the blockchain so far. One actually has to have the front-end in the classical web or some in-web services. Therefore, this is a huge advantage of the Internet Computer regarding scalability and security because everything is decentralized in the end. Regarding developer experience, Dfinity is trying to make it simple for developers because they\u2019re introducing their own language Motoko . Additionally, having the ability to program or develop in Rust makes it quite convenient for new developers to onboard. With me learning Motoko right now, it\u2019s quite interesting. It\u2019s a different type of language for me to learn, but so far, I find it\u2019s very intuitive. Many developers are also working on making tools to make developers\u2019 experience on IC more efficient and more convenient. Many tools will come up in the future and a whole ecosystem will evolve in the next couple of months and years.","title":"Questions 3"},{"location":"articles/AMA/DevelopmentStatusandFutureTrendsofEmergingNFTMarket/#questions-4","text":"Yufan: Having a sustainable business model that benefits all stakeholders is the guarantee for the long-term popularity of the blockchain ecosystem. Developers are an essential component of stakeholders in the blockchain ecosystem. How does the current business model in the NFT ecosystem benefit developers, and what are your thoughts on the current limitations and future development? Dr. Dustin: The NFT royalties give developers an incentive as a long-term revenue stream. I think you can group this into two parts, especially regarding NFTs. Developers can also be the creators of these NFTs because the NFTs can be artistic work, like classical artists\u2019 work. There\u2019s also a lot of digital artwork created by software developers or applications that can also be an NFT. A big benefit, of course, here is the concept of royalties. When you are a creator or developer developing some sort of NFT, which gets into the secondary market, there is a long-term revenue stream for these developers. Thus, this is really an incentive also for developers or creators to create their creative new types of NFTs. Figure 5: An Example of DAO: SharkDAO Having DAO structures gives every developer, no matter what kind of hierarchy, a voice in the end. Another benefit for developers working on ICP or other applications is basically that you have the tokenization of these various applications and Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAO) [1]\u2019s forming around these.

AMA Interview Video Watch our AMA interview for Dr. Gamborino on our SciEcon YouTube Channel \uff1a Figure 2: AMA Interview for Dr. Gamborino Read the Interview Scripts with annotations and references: Question 1 Tianyu: I notice that hedging and speculation are two main features of options. Do you think that the decentralized platform Hegic exists to encourage sustainable investment? Figure 3: Hegic Dr. Gamborino: This question allows for different levels of interpretation given the wide spectrum of what \u201csustainable investment\u201d can signify, and I think it is better to decompose the question into three different levels. (1) Is using ETH as a medium of exchange contributing to sustainable investment practices? Environmentally speaking, ETH has proven to be much more adaptive to ecological considerations when compared to its older brother Bitcoin and can be expected to gain even more ground in the future. Economically speaking, its high volatility hinders its use as a medium of exchange so this is an aspect that we would have to see if it persists into a much more mature ETH market. In terms of governance, assuming its protocol continues to work as its founder intended, I think Hegic is a world-class sustainable investing medium, owing to its decentralized nature. (2) Is the options trade contributing to the sustainability of the financial market? As far as I could go in my research, while classical considerations in option pricing do not consider an interaction between option trades and the price development of the underlying asset price, there is evidence that shows how option trading influences the pricing of the underlying asset (Ni et al., 2016) . If option trading is shown to reduce the volatility of the underlying asset, then I think it could positively contribute to the role Ethereum plays in sustainable investing. Figure 4: Sustainable Investment (3) Does Hegic encourage sustainable investing? Hegic\u2019s fundamental assumption is that in the long run, the returns obtained by liquidity providers beat the returns of solo options writers. Therefore, to properly evaluate the sustainability of Hegic, it is necessary to analyze the incentives given to liquidity providers and extrapolate if they are viable in the long run. For this, I found a recent article demonstrating this exact analysis and the author found that current data from Hegic suggest that pooled exposure for option sellers isn\u2019t sustainable if they have to rely strictly on the earned premiums. This leads to the conclusion that Hegic\u2019s future success depends on a tokenomics upgrade that would involve either a revenue redistribution from the stakers to Liquidity Providers or an insurance fund to cover their losses. Question 2 Tianyu: What are the potential risks and bugs in the smart contract of this decentralized derivatives trading platform, Hegic? Dr. Gamborino: The potential risks when using the Hegic Protocol are thoroughly explained in a Medium article written by Hegic itself. To summarize, risks native to the protocol design include potential losses on selling options as a liquidity provider and inability to withdraw funds when liquidity pools are maxed out, and loss of profits when you forget to exercise your options because that is not automated. Other potential risks are due to errors in the currency price feeds provided by Chainlink . Figure 5: Blockchain Oracles for Hybrid Smart Contracts: Chainlink On the other hand, bugs are practically inherent to any smart contract from any DeFi protocol. For Hegic in particular, we saw how this issue affected the protocol hours after the protocol was launched when a bug in its code locked up $28,000 worth of user funds in the platform\u2019s smart contracts. I also did a quick search, and found that Hegic\u2019s participation turned out on the platform called Immune\ufb01 , a bug bounty platform, detailing the most vulnerable avenues of hacks, bugs, and exploits. Exploring these avenues is necessary since in 2020 alone, hacks and scams cost the Defi community over $238 million in losses. While participation in a bug bounty program is worthy, the rate of the bounties offered by Hegic cap out at $50,000, which can be far below the economic gains offered or the economic loss that can be inflicted by exploiting a potential bug covered by that bounty. Question 3 Tianyu: What are the pros and cons of decentralized Option Applications in contrast to the centralized ones? Do you think traditional option trading platforms would migrate to blockchain in the future? What is the rationale behind this trend? Dr. Gamborino: To the best of my knowledge, the advantages of decentralized options are inherited from the general pros of DeFi relative to Centralized Finance, i.e. permissionless, trustless. However, there are several challenges or technical limitations of DeFi Options platforms. To mention some, first, expensive gas fees which make frequent trading unsustainable, second, option pricing is complicated and there is no uni\ufb01ed approach, and third, options market cannot exist without a reliable price feed from oracles. These are some issues to be addressed to make it a more attractive approach to blockchain. Question 4 Tianyu: What is your motivation for doing research about FinTech and blockchain and why do you decide to become an analyst in FinTech enterprises? Could you provide a case that you apply expertise in previous professional experience to the research in FinTech? Dr. Gamborino: To be honest, after withdrawing from my academic career in Physics, I was completely open to the job market. Since I am curious about many topics, I found many possibilities. However, the important criteria for my new job were that I could apply my background on an exciting and modern topic, as well as find the right people to work with. FinTech turned out to be most of this and more! I also met with a great team with a leader with a similar background in Physics and matching work values. I haven\u2019t used my expertise to research in FinTech yet but the first time I learned about how my background could be applied to study \ufb01nance was while I was doing my masters. At that time, I was working on studying the transport of heat in the solar corona which is a highly chaotic system that can be modeled as a stochastic process. My advisor then introduced me to how stock and option prices also follow a stochastic process, which immediately attracted my attention to the topic. Also, during this time, while learning several Machine Learning methods, I discovered that these could be applicable to stock and option pricing, for instance, there are several scientific papers showing how one of the machine learning methods, the Proper Orthogonal Decomposition Method can be used to price options, which is the same method I used when analyzing temperature maps of the solar corona. So there are so many connections and ways I could use my physics and mathematics background in the financial industry. Figure 6: Solar Corona Question 5 Tianyu: Internet computer (IC) is the first frictionless blockchain with web speed and internet-scale throughout the world. It extends the functionality of the public Internet so that it can host backend software, transforming it into a global computing platform. How do you think the IC can possibly empower the financial industry? How do you think IC can empower your career in FinTech? Dr. Gamborino: I am definitely no expert on IC technology, but as far as I understand, IC could empower the financial industry by using its features to replace the intermediary agents involved in asset management and transactions. While DeFi raised the exciting prospects of cutting out the middleman, the IC has ostensibly a better possibility of replacing the middleman in a more automated way. I think the greatest potential of IC is truly autonomous services. I also think that using IC, the governance of trust funds can be reinvented from a financial perspective, they need much less administration or administration can be automated using IC. Now, how I think the IC could empower my career in FinTech is something that is still to be explored as I grow and mature in this industry. We will see in the future, depending on my goals and my ambitions, if that aligns to what I see IC provides. Tianyu: Thank you, Dr. Gamborino! Basically, we are together learning from this new technique to empower our possibility in FinTech, so I hope that we can actually come back to further discussion later for the Internet Computer, and try to Figure out more in our career. Overall, your insight from options and your previous background is very valuable, especially for the young people who are interested in the FinTech area. Dr. Gamborino: Thank you very much for your interesting questions, Tianyu, and thanks to the SciEcon organization for facilitating this kind of event. I am very honored to have been part of this session. Last but not least, I would like to thank my husband Florian Schweizer for his incredible support and valuable input in understanding many of the concepts needed to answer the previous questions.

So there are so many connections and ways I could use my physics and mathematics background in the financial industry.

It extends the functionality of the public Internet so that it can host backend software, transforming it into a global computing platform. How do you think the IC can possibly empower the financial industry? How do you think IC can empower your career in FinTech? Dr. Gamborino: I am definitely no expert on IC technology, but as far as I understand, IC could empower the financial industry by using its features to replace the intermediary agents involved in asset management and transactions. While DeFi raised the exciting prospects of cutting out the middleman, the IC has ostensibly a better possibility of replacing the middleman in a more automated way. I think the greatest potential of IC is truly autonomous services. I also think that using IC, the governance of trust funds can be reinvented from a financial perspective, they need much less administration or administration can be automated using IC. Now, how I think the IC could empower my career in FinTech is something that is still to be explored as I grow and mature in this industry. We will see in the future, depending on my goals and my ambitions, if that aligns to what I see IC provides. Tianyu: Thank you, Dr. Gamborino! Basically, we are together learning from this new technique to empower our possibility in FinTech, so I hope that we can actually come back to further discussion later for the Internet Computer, and try to Figure out more in our career. Overall, your insight from options and your previous background is very valuable, especially for the young people who are interested in the FinTech area. Dr. Gamborino: Thank you very much for your interesting questions, Tianyu, and thanks to the SciEcon organization for facilitating this kind of event. I am very honored to have been part of this session. Last but not least, I would like to thank my husband Florian Schweizer for his incredible support and valuable input in understanding many of the concepts needed to answer the previous questions.","title":"Question 5"},{"location":"articles/AMA/HowtoRealizeOptionsTradinginDecentralizedFinance/#acknowledgments","text":"Interviewee: Dr. Diana Gamborino Interviewer: Tianyu Wu Associate Editor: Zichao Chen Executive Editors: Tianyu Wu, Xinyu Tian Advisor and Chief Editor: Prof. Luyao Zhang","title":"Acknowledgments:"},{"location":"articles/AMA/HowwillDeFiReshapetheFutureofFinance/","text":"How will DeFi Reshape the Future of Finance?

AMA Interview Video Watch our AMA interview for Prof. Campbell Harve y on our YouTube channel, SciEcon . Questions 1 William: In your book DeFi and Future of Finance , you write that \u201cthe scaffolding is emerging for a historic disruption of our current financial infrastructure\u201d, and you argue that \u201cthose fintech initiatives that use decentralized methods \u2014 in particular blockchain technology \u2014 have the best chance to define the future of finance\u201d. What leads to these comments in your book? Prof. Harvey: DeFi can rebuild traditional finance by lowering transaction costs. That is a question that deserves more than a few minutes of response, so let me be very clear as to what actually meant by the scaffolding of a new city. So, this is the type of disruption to finance that is not causing a renovation, but a rebuild from the bottom up. DeFi is a very, very powerful idea that we have the potential to completely rebuild finance as we know it. Figure 4: Western Union Transfer in 1873 In the book, I start with the history of finance, and it\u2019s kind of interesting that we started with a peer-to-peer system, and that was the barter system [1]. But in the last a hundred and fifty years we\u2019ve been stuck, so really not that much has changed, we got the same commercial banks, the same brokerages, the same stock exchanges, the same insurance companies. And it\u2019s interesting, also in the book, I start off with an image of one of the first wire transfers done in the world. Western Union was the pioneer here. It was from 1873. The transfer was $300. What\u2019s interesting for my students is that there was a fee associated with that, and the fee was $9 so the 3%, which is basically what we have today. So little has changed. 3% is what it costs you for a credit card swipe. I transferred some money to Europe the other day, and my bank said \u201cOh well, you\u2019re such a good customer, so we\u2019ll waive the fee\u201d. But the rate that they quoted was 3% off of the current market rate, so they\u2019re making 3% on that transfer. What does that mean? It means that we\u2019re stuck in a situation where the cost of transacting is very high. That means the savings rate that you get for putting your money in the bank is zero or maybe negative. Loan rates are very high. The system is not very inclusive. I point out in the book that 1.7 billion people are unbanked in the world today, and probably more are underbanked, and this causes so many problems. For example, say you\u2019re an entrepreneur. You have a great idea, and potentially the idea has a return on investment of 20%. You go to your bank for funding of that great idea, and your bank says, \u201cWell you\u2019re too small. We are not interested. We want to do business with the very largest firms, not you. If you definitely need the money, here is a credit card and we\u2019ll extend the credit limit. And oh yeah, by the way, the interest rate on the credit card is 24%!\u201d Figure 5: Centralized and Decentralized Finance What does that mean? It means that this really good project will not be being pursued. And, we need projects like this. That is what drives real economic growth. The US is stuck in this 2\u20133% growth range, Europe in the 1\u20132%, Japan in the zero percent. China is doing a lot better, but we all know that the growth rate is decreasing and it is crucial given the demographics of China that the growth rate remains very high. So a lot is at stake here, and our current centralized financial system is basically causing a problem. That problem directly leads to lower investment, lower employment, lower GDP growth. I think that is the big picture context of where decentralized finance comes in. Questions 2 William: It\u2019s great to hear how you think centralized finance can contribute to the world economy in general. We also know that El Salvador recently adopts Bitcoin as their official currency for a very similar reason, the high transaction fee you\u2019ve been talking about. How do you think DeFi will reshape the finance industry? We also noticed that the co-authors of your new book are entrepreneurs and investors. How do you think DeFi will reshape the way that scholars research finance and collaborate with practitioners? Prof. Harvey: DeFi can disrupt centralized finance, other fintech, and centralized crypto exchanges by enabling users to directly interact with peers. So I have to admit that the academics are well behind a lot of practitioners on this. So, I was at a conference before the pandemic, and there were 300 finance academics. I was doing a speech, and I said \u201craise your hand if you know what DeFi means\u201d. There were like two people that put their hands up. Okay, think of that: two people out of 300. More know about it today, but these are supposedly the thought leaders \u2014 they are the teachers of the next generation. You mentioned El Salvador is adopting Bitcoin as a legal tender [2] and most of the news is on Bitcoin: it\u2019s going up or down, or Elon Musk is saying something about Dogecoin or Bitcoin. Figure 6: Apps and DApps Decentralized finance is something completely different. So decentralized finance is not about speculating in Bitcoin. Decentralized finance mainly focuses on the Ethereum blockchain [3], which is a different (but related blockchain) than Bitcoin, and crucially it allows for smart contracts or what we call decentralized apps (dApps) [4]. The key thing here is with a dApp you interact with your peers. So, currently when we have an App, like on our phone, we\u2019re interacting through a middle person collecting data, pushing advertising to us, exploiting us by selling our data. But decentralized finance is completely different, because it is truly a peer-to-peer system. We\u2019re interacting with a computer program, a smart contract [5] that exists in the Ethereum blockchain, which is completely transparent so anybody can see it. The code is available. If you\u2019re doing business with somebody, you know exactly what their balance is. You see all of the history of transactions. There\u2019s no middle person to make a spread. There is seamless interoperability between these applications. So today, for example, it takes two or three days for me to transfer money from my bank to my broker, or vice versa. There\u2019s nothing like that in decentralized finance. These applications work together, and any transfer is immediate. So indeed, the difference between transaction settlements doesn\u2019t exist. If you buy a stock in the US today, it takes two days before the stock\u2019s ownership is transferred to your name. In decentralized finance there\u2019s nothing like that. When you do the transaction, the asset is signed over to your private key, and it happens at the same time as the trade. I think it\u2019s also useful for people to realize the difference between (DeFi) and let\u2019s say, trading with a centralized exchange like Binance [6] or Coinbase [7]. Those are centralized, so there\u2019s a broker that is just like traditional brokers, but they deal in decentralized finance. So there\u2019s a middle person. They make a spread. So, again there\u2019s just no difference (between centralized exchanges and traditional finance). Figure 7: Decentralized Exchanges In decentralized finance, when we talk about the exchange, we talk about DEX or decentralized exchange [8]. This is where you\u2019re trading with an algorithm. The algorithm doesn\u2019t care if you\u2019re a buyer or a seller. And you can exactly Figure out the price that you\u2019re going to get given the balances that are in this algorithm in terms of the liquidity pool. People supply liquidity, they get paid for that, there are small transaction fees that are associated with this, and those transaction fees just basically reward those providing liquidity (or provide a backup pool of money for risk management). There\u2019s no brick and mortar, there\u2019s no back office, there\u2019s no headquarters, and there\u2019s no board of directors. This is an algorithm. And it reduces costs. You know economists disagree upon a lot of things. But there\u2019s one thing that they agree upon, and that is if you\u2019re reducing transaction costs, that\u2019s really good for the economy in general. This is exactly what this disruption is doing. I\u2019ll give you an example of just how big this disruption is. I was invited to speak to one of the major stock exchanges in the world, which remains unnamed. I flew in, and I knew I was going to talk about blockchain-type of topics, but there was no agenda specifically. I got there, and they had their board of directors, which was interesting plus all their senior management. They basically had just one question, \u201cHow long do we have?\u201d OK, so the centralized institutions know that it\u2019s a matter of time that they will be disrupted by this technology. Even for centralized institutions like Binance, their major competitors are the decentralized exchanges, and they know it. If you look at trading volume, you can see this. It\u2019s kind of interesting the way I look at it. There\u2019s a lot of fintech out there, and most of the fintech reduces some frictions in traditional centralized finance. So, you get to trade, let\u2019s say, your stocks with a lower fee than (trading) traditionally, which is good for investors. But it\u2019s all temporary, in my opinion. So fintech that uses the legacy centralized financial structure will be disrupted by decentralized finance . While it\u2019s good in the short term, it probably just doesn\u2019t have the legs for the future. Decentralized finance, well as young right now, is less than 1% into this disruption. It\u2019s on the right path, and that path will have many bumps in the road, and my book is very careful to point out the risks of this innovation. Any new technology has a risk. If you want something risk-free, then you\u2019re not going to advance, so you\u2019re satisfied with that zero percent (or negative) real economic growth. So you need to take risks, and there will be challenges. We need to expect there will be issues. Figure 8: Blockchain Forks But the good thing about decentralized finance, given that everything is open-source, is that somebody if they see an improvement that can be made on an existing protocol [9], they can just fork [10] it, which means you just copy the code, make your change and then launch a competitor. Can you imagine that happening in traditional finance? For example, you have some interface with your bank and you make a suggestion to make it a little easier for the user, it can take years to actually change. This can happen in less than a day (in DeFi). You make the change, you have a new product, and you launch it. And for everything that fails, you Figure out how it failed, you fix it, and you relaunch. So this idea of fork-ability is a really powerful idea, and it allows for these protocols to change and improve very quickly . In centralized finance these commercial banks have hundreds of thousands of lines of legacy code, it is so difficult for them to do anything innovative, whereas in decentralized finance it\u2019s very quick. Questions 3 William: Thank you so much for talking so much about DeFi! I totally agree with you that there\u2019s too much attention given to Bitcoin, dogecoin, and speculation, but actually it is the DeFi that really represents the future because it hugely reduces friction in the economy while improving efficiency and speed of innovation. So we know that you have taught the class \u201cInnovation and Cryptoventures\u201d at Fuqua for many years, and you have held a Coursera class \u201cBlockchain Business Model\u201d. Why do you think it is so important for students, scholars, and business leaders to understand blockchain technology? What is the best way to learn, teach, and practice blockchain in finance? Prof. Harvey: People need to understand DeFi to be disruptors rather than disruptees. Yeah, so it\u2019s interesting, again this is a great technological innovation. I\u2019m glad that the students at Duke are able to access my course. Indeed I have two courses at Duke. One is \u201cInnovation and Cryptoventures\u201d, which is the DeFi course. I\u2019ve also taught another course called \u201cTech-driven Transformation and Business\u201d. We do more than blockchain there. We also do quantum computing and brain-machine interface. So, those are the three technologies that I believe which are just incredibly disruptive for the future. But the goal here is really simple for me: I want to position my students so that they have a chance to have a vision of the future. They need to make very important decisions that impact the value of their human capital. And I want them to be disruptors rather than disruptees . So, my goal is to present the vision of the future for my students. I\u2019m not a person that does case studies, which to me is the study of the past. I\u2019m very unconventional and I enjoy interacting with my Duke students. But, I have more ambition, and that involves reaching out to the rest of the world. My book is part of that, but I\u2019m also launching a learning experience on Coursera that is called DeFi and the Future of Finance . It consists of four different courses. It follows the book and structure but there\u2019s a lot of extra material that I work in. So it begins with the first course on fundamentals, DeFi Infrastructure, that talks about what money actually is, the history of money, and some of the key concepts that underlie DeFi. The second course is called DeFi Primitives. Here I talk about the building blocks of DeFi and how those building blocks actually work, as some of these algorithmic formulas for, for example, a bonding curve [11]. Indeed, in the very first part of the course I put up a word cloud and it has about 75 different words. Figure 9: Word Cloud in the course \u201c Innovation and Cryptoventures \u201d Some of the words you actually know, but you don\u2019t know them in the context of DeFi, like minting or slashing. So, the primitives go through many of those words, and by the time we finish the second course, students are in pretty good shape on the structure. Figure 10: Top 10 DeFi Projects Then the third course is called DeFi Deep Dive . And there I go and examine the leading protocols. I look at Compound [12], Aave [13] and MakerDAO [14]. And then I look at exchanges: Uniswap V2 and V3 [15], and look at Balancer [16] as an alternative. And then I look at derivatives markets including dYdX and tokenization. That\u2019s very practically-oriented to understand the key protocols in DeFi. The fourth course is the DeFi Risks and Opportunities. So there\u2019s an extensive discussion of the major risks, for example, scalability . We just don\u2019t have the capacity that centralized finances have. So maybe you can do 18 transactions per second on Ethereum. But Visa is doing 25,000 and can do 75,000. That\u2019s going to change next year in Ethereum but it\u2019s still a risk that we need that throughput to be greatly increased. Figure 11: Environmental Risk of Bitcoin Also the environmental risk . So, for example, Bitcoin and Ethereum use a very energy-intensive algorithm to ensure the security of their blockchain and much of that energy is not clean. So, that poses a significant risk. Ethereum will mitigate that risk or eliminate it effectively when they switch to a different mechanism called Proof of Stake [17]. Bitcoin is not going to change, but again I don\u2019t really talk that much about Bitcoin in my courses. It\u2019s the first crypto, it needs to be understood, and I expect that we will see the environmental risk for Bitcoin mitigated when we move the energy-intensive mining from areas like China, where it\u2019s really carbon-intensive to areas that have locked, clean energy, which means countries like Iceland that have essentially unlimited geothermal which is clean but they can\u2019t export the energy because of their isolated location. So I think that would be resolved also but the risks are really important to understand. William: Yes, thank you, Prof. Harvey. It\u2019s really great news for us to hear that you have launched your course module, and I think the fellow students here and our other audience will be very interested in having such a systematic education on DeFi. It will be great, and we will really appreciate your work. Prof. Harvey: Just to be clear that the four-course sequence is not completed yet, so it\u2019s not launched yet. I\u2019m working on it. I\u2019ve shot two and a half of the courses, and next week I\u2019ll finish the other one and a half. And it will be launched within hopefully a month on Coursera. Questions 4 William: So the next question will be on the Internet Computer (IC) [17]. We mentioned this a bit in the email, but I will introduce it here again. It\u2019s the first frictionless blockchain with web speed and internet-scale throughout the world. It extends the functionality of the public Internet so that it can host backend software, transforming it into a global computing platform. Imagine a Twitter or even TikTok built on a blockchain. Do you think IC, or any other decentralized technology, can solve the Blockchain trilemma decentralization, scalability, security)? How do you think the IC can possibly empower the financial industry? Prof. Harvey: Blockchain has huge potential in many more applications. Again you pose a very complex question. So, there are many initiatives going on in terms of blockchain technology. And it\u2019s really important to realize that the low-hanging fruit for blockchain technology is the financial applications, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re mainly seeing right now. But there are many other applications of this technology and the appeal is very significant. Because if you have a secure blockchain like the Bitcoin blockchain or Ethereum blockchain, it is basically a record that can\u2019t be tampered with, so you can\u2019t edit the past . Immutability is a key characteristic of blockchain technology. For example, hackers and nefarious actors, or even the government can\u2019t go in and change the past. So if this says you own something in that blockchain record, then you own it; nobody can take that away from you. Figure 12: Blockchain Technology So, this is a very attractive technology for many different applications. And we do study in my course some of these applications outside of finance. It can be used for identity , which is a very logical application. It can be used for another kind of low-hanging fruit application \u2014 the supply chain . It exists today, where you walk into your store, there\u2019s some lettuce, it has a QR on it, you scan the QR, and you know where that lettuce was picked, whether it\u2019s organic or not, the day it was picked, every single hop on the supply chain, and how long it has been on the shelf at the local store. That\u2019s all blockchain-based, and again nobody\u2019s going to edit it. So, you can imagine something on the shelf for like a week, and the store edited it (changes the label) saying, we just put it out a few hours ago. We don\u2019t want that to happen. It\u2019s credible to do this (with blockchain). Figure 13: Internet Computer You mentioned the Internet. The whole DNS [18], the structure, is highly centralized. And that needs change. The Internet initially was an idea of decentralization, but it isn\u2019t decentralized, and there are many different challenges. But blockchain technology offers the possibility of a truly decentralized Internet. What will happen: decentralized file storage, decentralized computing. All of these actually exist today in a limited form: they haven\u2019t been fully realized, but they will be realized. Energy, electrical grids, there are just so many applications here of this technology. We\u2019re just at the beginning. This is, again, the tip of the iceberg, and we are at less than 1% of the realization, so there\u2019s a lot of upsides here. You mentioned how to learn about crypto space. It\u2019s hard to find good sites for this, but it\u2019s an extraordinary opportunity for young people especially. This is exactly where you want to be, at less than 1% point in the disruption because that means that you can be part of this revolution. And that means there are so many opportunities. Don\u2019t be discouraged if you\u2019re not a computer scientist. The most important trait here is creativity. You identify a problem, and you determine whether blockchain is a viable solution to that problem. If it is, then armed with your idea, and you can find a developer to help you out with it. So, my course is called Innovation and Cryptoventures . The innovation is that my students need to propose a new idea. And you need to propose an idea like a venture capitalist would be receiving an idea. I\u2019m the venture capitalist, and I\u2019m the one that\u2019s assessing the quality of the ideas. It\u2019s 50% of the grade, and I\u2019m pretty tough. Question 5 William: It\u2019s very inspiring as young people to hear you saying blockchain is only a tip of the iceberg currently, and I think your effort would certainly encourage more people to jump into this field! The last question today is about risk, as you mentioned in our previous talks and also in your book on the seven risk factors of DeFi. We know some people have criticized that cryptocurrencies provide convenience for say, ransomware as we\u2019ve seen in the recent Colonial case, and money laundering. We have also seen concerns from the policymakers from the US, EU, and China about the use of cryptocurrencies. How do you think these risk factors may endanger the prospect of DeFi? Do you see any potential solutions to the risk factors that you mentioned in the book? Prof. Harvey: The benefits cryptocurrencies bring outweigh the risk factors. A great question, and a great question to end up on. This is really important. Any new technology has got some risk. As I mentioned earlier, if there\u2019s no risk, there\u2019s no upside. That\u2019s kind of the most basic rule of finance. Figure 14: Cash of El Chapo So, there is a risk, and there is some criminal activity that is done with cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin in particular. But it is minor compared to the criminal activity that\u2019s done with cash. I showed a picture of this famous Mexican drug lord called El Chapo and the raid of his house in Mexico. There\u2019s a room that has got 200 million dollars of one-hundred-dollar bills. Why? Cash is anonymous. It\u2019s a big misunderstanding to think that Bitcoin is completely anonymous. You can be anonymous initially. You can set up an address and say, \u201csend me this ransom and I\u2019ll unlock your hard drive\u201d. Everybody sees that the ransom transfer. Everybody sees the money goes to that address, and then you might try to mix it around by sending it to some other addresses. Everybody sees the other addresses. Every transfer is visible to anybody, including law enforcement. And then you have to get it out. So how do you monetize it? How do you eventually transfer that Bitcoin to something else? It might be dollars, it might be gold, and it might be diamonds. Well then, you have to go off-chain. Again, this is a system where the ledger cannot be altered, so your illegal transaction is there forever. When you\u2019re caught and you go to court, it is swift justice, because the ledger shows this illegal transaction. Nobody can change the ledger. You\u2019re done. So, it turns out that things like Bitcoin or Ethereum are probably the last technology that you want to use for doing anything illegal, because they are public \u2014 the ledger is public. Figure 15: Blockchain Transactions are Transparent People talk about this and it gets a lot of press, just like Bitcoin gets a lot of press. Oh well, there\u2019s some Colonial pipeline ransomware and stuff like that. That will continue to go on. But there\u2019s a bigger issue here that there are some cryptos that are truly anonymous [19]. This issue is not just an issue with cryptocurrency, but it is an issue in general. We have our encrypted apps where we can send messages that nobody else can see, or we can talk or do a video completely encrypted. That also potentially enables terrorism or illegal activity, which is a bigger issue than blockchain, and it\u2019s a mistake to just focus on some of the illegal activity. I asked my students what they think the proportion of one-hundred-dollar bills in terms of all the US currency actually is, and they\u2019re thinking well, maybe 10% or 15%. It is 79%. And nobody has one. If you try to go to a store and pay with a hundred-dollar bill, they\u2019re not going to take it. So where are those hundred-dollar bills? El Chapo. So, this criticism is largely a false criticism, nevertheless, it is discussed in public, we have to deal with that because it\u2019s kind of a media-friendly story. But again, we need to look beyond. For any new technology, there will be some costs, so this might be one of the costs. But you need to weigh that with the benefits, and the benefits are VERY substantial. This is, again, like a revolution. And I feel that my academic colleagues that are studying banking, and there\u2019s a large number of academics that are in that field, are really missing something big. For those that go to traditional banks for their jobs, I tell them, go there, and then the first day you\u2019re there, you should be looking to jump to the next job, because there isn\u2019t a long-term future for you in traditional banking. And it really comes down to what I said at the beginning of our talk, that this is a revolution, and you have the opportunity to be part of it, or, be swept away by it. William: Thank you, Prof. Harvey! I think it\u2019s a great response to the risk factors, and I really like how the benefits outweigh the risks in decentralized finance. I think your insights are really valuable for us, especially the young people in our audience at Duke and DKU. I believe that our conversation today will inspire more people to think more about DeFi and even work on it. Thank you again for joining the interview today! Prof. Harvey: Great, thank you for inviting me.

What leads to these comments in your book? Prof. Harvey: DeFi can rebuild traditional finance by lowering transaction costs. That is a question that deserves more than a few minutes of response, so let me be very clear as to what actually meant by the scaffolding of a new city. So, this is the type of disruption to finance that is not causing a renovation, but a rebuild from the bottom up. DeFi is a very, very powerful idea that we have the potential to completely rebuild finance as we know it. Figure 4: Western Union Transfer in 1873 In the book, I start with the history of finance, and it\u2019s kind of interesting that we started with a peer-to-peer system, and that was the barter system [1]. But in the last a hundred and fifty years we\u2019ve been stuck, so really not that much has changed, we got the same commercial banks, the same brokerages, the same stock exchanges, the same insurance companies. And it\u2019s interesting, also in the book, I start off with an image of one of the first wire transfers done in the world. Western Union was the pioneer here. It was from 1873. The transfer was $300. What\u2019s interesting for my students is that there was a fee associated with that, and the fee was $9 so the 3%, which is basically what we have today. So little has changed. 3% is what it costs you for a credit card swipe. I transferred some money to Europe the other day, and my bank said \u201cOh well, you\u2019re such a good customer, so we\u2019ll waive the fee\u201d. But the rate that they quoted was 3% off of the current market rate, so they\u2019re making 3% on that transfer. What does that mean? It means that we\u2019re stuck in a situation where the cost of transacting is very high. That means the savings rate that you get for putting your money in the bank is zero or maybe negative. Loan rates are very high. The system is not very inclusive. I point out in the book that 1.7 billion people are unbanked in the world today, and probably more are underbanked, and this causes so many problems. For example, say you\u2019re an entrepreneur. You have a great idea, and potentially the idea has a return on investment of 20%. You go to your bank for funding of that great idea, and your bank says, \u201cWell you\u2019re too small. We are not interested. We want to do business with the very largest firms, not you. If you definitely need the money, here is a credit card and we\u2019ll extend the credit limit. And oh yeah, by the way, the interest rate on the credit card is 24%!\u201d Figure 5: Centralized and Decentralized Finance What does that mean? It means that this really good project will not be being pursued. And, we need projects like this. That is what drives real economic growth. The US is stuck in this 2\u20133% growth range, Europe in the 1\u20132%, Japan in the zero percent. China is doing a lot better, but we all know that the growth rate is decreasing and it is crucial given the demographics of China that the growth rate remains very high. So a lot is at stake here, and our current centralized financial system is basically causing a problem. That problem directly leads to lower investment, lower employment, lower GDP growth. I think that is the big picture context of where decentralized finance comes in.","title":"Questions 1"},{"location":"articles/AMA/HowwillDeFiReshapetheFutureofFinance/#questions-2","text":"William: It\u2019s great to hear how you think centralized finance can contribute to the world economy in general. We also know that El Salvador recently adopts Bitcoin as their official currency for a very similar reason, the high transaction fee you\u2019ve been talking about. How do you think DeFi will reshape the finance industry? We also noticed that the co-authors of your new book are entrepreneurs and investors. How do you think DeFi will reshape the way that scholars research finance and collaborate with practitioners? Prof. Harvey: DeFi can disrupt centralized finance, other fintech, and centralized crypto exchanges by enabling users to directly interact with peers. So I have to admit that the academics are well behind a lot of practitioners on this. So, I was at a conference before the pandemic, and there were 300 finance academics. I was doing a speech, and I said \u201craise your hand if you know what DeFi means\u201d. There were like two people that put their hands up. Okay, think of that: two people out of 300. More know about it today, but these are supposedly the thought leaders \u2014 they are the teachers of the next generation. You mentioned El Salvador is adopting Bitcoin as a legal tender [2] and most of the news is on Bitcoin: it\u2019s going up or down, or Elon Musk is saying something about Dogecoin or Bitcoin. Figure 6: Apps and DApps Decentralized finance is something completely different. So decentralized finance is not about speculating in Bitcoin. Decentralized finance mainly focuses on the Ethereum blockchain [3], which is a different (but related blockchain) than Bitcoin, and crucially it allows for smart contracts or what we call decentralized apps (dApps) [4]. The key thing here is with a dApp you interact with your peers. So, currently when we have an App, like on our phone, we\u2019re interacting through a middle person collecting data, pushing advertising to us, exploiting us by selling our data. But decentralized finance is completely different, because it is truly a peer-to-peer system. We\u2019re interacting with a computer program, a smart contract [5] that exists in the Ethereum blockchain, which is completely transparent so anybody can see it. The code is available. If you\u2019re doing business with somebody, you know exactly what their balance is. You see all of the history of transactions. There\u2019s no middle person to make a spread. There is seamless interoperability between these applications. So today, for example, it takes two or three days for me to transfer money from my bank to my broker, or vice versa. There\u2019s nothing like that in decentralized finance. These applications work together, and any transfer is immediate. So indeed, the difference between transaction settlements doesn\u2019t exist. If you buy a stock in the US today, it takes two days before the stock\u2019s ownership is transferred to your name. In decentralized finance there\u2019s nothing like that. When you do the transaction, the asset is signed over to your private key, and it happens at the same time as the trade. I think it\u2019s also useful for people to realize the difference between (DeFi) and let\u2019s say, trading with a centralized exchange like Binance [6] or Coinbase [7]. Those are centralized, so there\u2019s a broker that is just like traditional brokers, but they deal in decentralized finance. So there\u2019s a middle person. They make a spread. So, again there\u2019s just no difference (between centralized exchanges and traditional finance). Figure 7: Decentralized Exchanges In decentralized finance, when we talk about the exchange, we talk about DEX or decentralized exchange [8]. This is where you\u2019re trading with an algorithm. The algorithm doesn\u2019t care if you\u2019re a buyer or a seller. And you can exactly Figure out the price that you\u2019re going to get given the balances that are in this algorithm in terms of the liquidity pool. People supply liquidity, they get paid for that, there are small transaction fees that are associated with this, and those transaction fees just basically reward those providing liquidity (or provide a backup pool of money for risk management). There\u2019s no brick and mortar, there\u2019s no back office, there\u2019s no headquarters, and there\u2019s no board of directors. This is an algorithm. And it reduces costs. You know economists disagree upon a lot of things. But there\u2019s one thing that they agree upon, and that is if you\u2019re reducing transaction costs, that\u2019s really good for the economy in general. This is exactly what this disruption is doing. I\u2019ll give you an example of just how big this disruption is. I was invited to speak to one of the major stock exchanges in the world, which remains unnamed. I flew in, and I knew I was going to talk about blockchain-type of topics, but there was no agenda specifically. I got there, and they had their board of directors, which was interesting plus all their senior management. They basically had just one question, \u201cHow long do we have?\u201d OK, so the centralized institutions know that it\u2019s a matter of time that they will be disrupted by this technology. Even for centralized institutions like Binance, their major competitors are the decentralized exchanges, and they know it. If you look at trading volume, you can see this. It\u2019s kind of interesting the way I look at it. There\u2019s a lot of fintech out there, and most of the fintech reduces some frictions in traditional centralized finance. So, you get to trade, let\u2019s say, your stocks with a lower fee than (trading) traditionally, which is good for investors. But it\u2019s all temporary, in my opinion. So fintech that uses the legacy centralized financial structure will be disrupted by decentralized finance . While it\u2019s good in the short term, it probably just doesn\u2019t have the legs for the future. Decentralized finance, well as young right now, is less than 1% into this disruption. It\u2019s on the right path, and that path will have many bumps in the road, and my book is very careful to point out the risks of this innovation. Any new technology has a risk. If you want something risk-free, then you\u2019re not going to advance, so you\u2019re satisfied with that zero percent (or negative) real economic growth. So you need to take risks, and there will be challenges. We need to expect there will be issues. Figure 8: Blockchain Forks But the good thing about decentralized finance, given that everything is open-source, is that somebody if they see an improvement that can be made on an existing protocol [9], they can just fork [10] it, which means you just copy the code, make your change and then launch a competitor. Can you imagine that happening in traditional finance? For example, you have some interface with your bank and you make a suggestion to make it a little easier for the user, it can take years to actually change. This can happen in less than a day (in DeFi). You make the change, you have a new product, and you launch it. And for everything that fails, you Figure out how it failed, you fix it, and you relaunch. So this idea of fork-ability is a really powerful idea, and it allows for these protocols to change and improve very quickly . In centralized finance these commercial banks have hundreds of thousands of lines of legacy code, it is so difficult for them to do anything innovative, whereas in decentralized finance it\u2019s very quick.","title":"Questions 2"},{"location":"articles/AMA/HowwillDeFiReshapetheFutureofFinance/#questions-3","text":"William: Thank you so much for talking so much about DeFi! I totally agree with you that there\u2019s too much attention given to Bitcoin, dogecoin, and speculation, but actually it is the DeFi that really represents the future because it hugely reduces friction in the economy while improving efficiency and speed of innovation. So we know that you have taught the class \u201cInnovation and Cryptoventures\u201d at Fuqua for many years, and you have held a Coursera class \u201cBlockchain Business Model\u201d. Why do you think it is so important for students, scholars, and business leaders to understand blockchain technology? What is the best way to learn, teach, and practice blockchain in finance? Prof. Harvey: People need to understand DeFi to be disruptors rather than disruptees. Yeah, so it\u2019s interesting, again this is a great technological innovation. I\u2019m glad that the students at Duke are able to access my course. Indeed I have two courses at Duke. One is \u201cInnovation and Cryptoventures\u201d, which is the DeFi course. I\u2019ve also taught another course called \u201cTech-driven Transformation and Business\u201d. We do more than blockchain there. We also do quantum computing and brain-machine interface. So, those are the three technologies that I believe which are just incredibly disruptive for the future. But the goal here is really simple for me: I want to position my students so that they have a chance to have a vision of the future. They need to make very important decisions that impact the value of their human capital. And I want them to be disruptors rather than disruptees . So, my goal is to present the vision of the future for my students. I\u2019m not a person that does case studies, which to me is the study of the past. I\u2019m very unconventional and I enjoy interacting with my Duke students. But, I have more ambition, and that involves reaching out to the rest of the world. My book is part of that, but I\u2019m also launching a learning experience on Coursera that is called DeFi and the Future of Finance . It consists of four different courses. It follows the book and structure but there\u2019s a lot of extra material that I work in. So it begins with the first course on fundamentals, DeFi Infrastructure, that talks about what money actually is, the history of money, and some of the key concepts that underlie DeFi. The second course is called DeFi Primitives. Here I talk about the building blocks of DeFi and how those building blocks actually work, as some of these algorithmic formulas for, for example, a bonding curve [11]. Indeed, in the very first part of the course I put up a word cloud and it has about 75 different words. Figure 9: Word Cloud in the course \u201c Innovation and Cryptoventures \u201d Some of the words you actually know, but you don\u2019t know them in the context of DeFi, like minting or slashing. So, the primitives go through many of those words, and by the time we finish the second course, students are in pretty good shape on the structure. Figure 10: Top 10 DeFi Projects Then the third course is called DeFi Deep Dive . And there I go and examine the leading protocols. I look at Compound [12], Aave [13] and MakerDAO [14]. And then I look at exchanges: Uniswap V2 and V3 [15], and look at Balancer [16] as an alternative. And then I look at derivatives markets including dYdX and tokenization. That\u2019s very practically-oriented to understand the key protocols in DeFi. The fourth course is the DeFi Risks and Opportunities. So there\u2019s an extensive discussion of the major risks, for example, scalability . We just don\u2019t have the capacity that centralized finances have. So maybe you can do 18 transactions per second on Ethereum. But Visa is doing 25,000 and can do 75,000. That\u2019s going to change next year in Ethereum but it\u2019s still a risk that we need that throughput to be greatly increased. Figure 11: Environmental Risk of Bitcoin Also the environmental risk . So, for example, Bitcoin and Ethereum use a very energy-intensive algorithm to ensure the security of their blockchain and much of that energy is not clean. So, that poses a significant risk. Ethereum will mitigate that risk or eliminate it effectively when they switch to a different mechanism called Proof of Stake [17]. Bitcoin is not going to change, but again I don\u2019t really talk that much about Bitcoin in my courses. It\u2019s the first crypto, it needs to be understood, and I expect that we will see the environmental risk for Bitcoin mitigated when we move the energy-intensive mining from areas like China, where it\u2019s really carbon-intensive to areas that have locked, clean energy, which means countries like Iceland that have essentially unlimited geothermal which is clean but they can\u2019t export the energy because of their isolated location. So I think that would be resolved also but the risks are really important to understand. William: Yes, thank you, Prof. Harvey. It\u2019s really great news for us to hear that you have launched your course module, and I think the fellow students here and our other audience will be very interested in having such a systematic education on DeFi. It will be great, and we will really appreciate your work. Prof. Harvey: Just to be clear that the four-course sequence is not completed yet, so it\u2019s not launched yet. I\u2019m working on it. I\u2019ve shot two and a half of the courses, and next week I\u2019ll finish the other one and a half. And it will be launched within hopefully a month on Coursera.","title":"Questions 3"},{"location":"articles/AMA/HowwillDeFiReshapetheFutureofFinance/#questions-4","text":"William: So the next question will be on the Internet Computer (IC) [17]. We mentioned this a bit in the email, but I will introduce it here again. It\u2019s the first frictionless blockchain with web speed and internet-scale throughout the world. It extends the functionality of the public Internet so that it can host backend software, transforming it into a global computing platform. Imagine a Twitter or even TikTok built on a blockchain. Do you think IC, or any other decentralized technology, can solve the Blockchain trilemma decentralization, scalability, security)? How do you think the IC can possibly empower the financial industry? Prof. Harvey: Blockchain has huge potential in many more applications. Again you pose a very complex question. So, there are many initiatives going on in terms of blockchain technology. And it\u2019s really important to realize that the low-hanging fruit for blockchain technology is the financial applications, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re mainly seeing right now. But there are many other applications of this technology and the appeal is very significant. Because if you have a secure blockchain like the Bitcoin blockchain or Ethereum blockchain, it is basically a record that can\u2019t be tampered with, so you can\u2019t edit the past . Immutability is a key characteristic of blockchain technology. For example, hackers and nefarious actors, or even the government can\u2019t go in and change the past. So if this says you own something in that blockchain record, then you own it; nobody can take that away from you. Figure 12: Blockchain Technology So, this is a very attractive technology for many different applications. And we do study in my course some of these applications outside of finance. It can be used for identity , which is a very logical application. It can be used for another kind of low-hanging fruit application \u2014 the supply chain . It exists today, where you walk into your store, there\u2019s some lettuce, it has a QR on it, you scan the QR, and you know where that lettuce was picked, whether it\u2019s organic or not, the day it was picked, every single hop on the supply chain, and how long it has been on the shelf at the local store. That\u2019s all blockchain-based, and again nobody\u2019s going to edit it. So, you can imagine something on the shelf for like a week, and the store edited it (changes the label) saying, we just put it out a few hours ago. We don\u2019t want that to happen. It\u2019s credible to do this (with blockchain). Figure 13: Internet Computer You mentioned the Internet. The whole DNS [18], the structure, is highly centralized. And that needs change. The Internet initially was an idea of decentralization, but it isn\u2019t decentralized, and there are many different challenges. But blockchain technology offers the possibility of a truly decentralized Internet. What will happen: decentralized file storage, decentralized computing. All of these actually exist today in a limited form: they haven\u2019t been fully realized, but they will be realized. Energy, electrical grids, there are just so many applications here of this technology. We\u2019re just at the beginning. This is, again, the tip of the iceberg, and we are at less than 1% of the realization, so there\u2019s a lot of upsides here. You mentioned how to learn about crypto space. It\u2019s hard to find good sites for this, but it\u2019s an extraordinary opportunity for young people especially. This is exactly where you want to be, at less than 1% point in the disruption because that means that you can be part of this revolution. And that means there are so many opportunities. Don\u2019t be discouraged if you\u2019re not a computer scientist. The most important trait here is creativity. You identify a problem, and you determine whether blockchain is a viable solution to that problem. If it is, then armed with your idea, and you can find a developer to help you out with it. So, my course is called Innovation and Cryptoventures . The innovation is that my students need to propose a new idea. And you need to propose an idea like a venture capitalist would be receiving an idea. I\u2019m the venture capitalist, and I\u2019m the one that\u2019s assessing the quality of the ideas. It\u2019s 50% of the grade, and I\u2019m pretty tough.","title":"Questions 4"},{"location":"articles/AMA/HowwillDeFiReshapetheFutureofFinance/#question-5","text":"William: It\u2019s very inspiring as young people to hear you saying blockchain is only a tip of the iceberg currently, and I think your effort would certainly encourage more people to jump into this field! The last question today is about risk, as you mentioned in our previous talks and also in your book on the seven risk factors of DeFi. We know some people have criticized that cryptocurrencies provide convenience for say, ransomware as we\u2019ve seen in the recent Colonial case, and money laundering. We have also seen concerns from the policymakers from the US, EU, and China about the use of cryptocurrencies. How do you think these risk factors may endanger the prospect of DeFi? Do you see any potential solutions to the risk factors that you mentioned in the book? Prof. Harvey: The benefits cryptocurrencies bring outweigh the risk factors. A great question, and a great question to end up on. This is really important. Any new technology has got some risk. As I mentioned earlier, if there\u2019s no risk, there\u2019s no upside. That\u2019s kind of the most basic rule of finance. Figure 14: Cash of El Chapo So, there is a risk, and there is some criminal activity that is done with cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin in particular. But it is minor compared to the criminal activity that\u2019s done with cash. I showed a picture of this famous Mexican drug lord called El Chapo and the raid of his house in Mexico. There\u2019s a room that has got 200 million dollars of one-hundred-dollar bills. Why? Cash is anonymous. It\u2019s a big misunderstanding to think that Bitcoin is completely anonymous. You can be anonymous initially. You can set up an address and say, \u201csend me this ransom and I\u2019ll unlock your hard drive\u201d. Everybody sees that the ransom transfer. Everybody sees the money goes to that address, and then you might try to mix it around by sending it to some other addresses. Everybody sees the other addresses. Every transfer is visible to anybody, including law enforcement. And then you have to get it out. So how do you monetize it? How do you eventually transfer that Bitcoin to something else? It might be dollars, it might be gold, and it might be diamonds. Well then, you have to go off-chain. Again, this is a system where the ledger cannot be altered, so your illegal transaction is there forever. When you\u2019re caught and you go to court, it is swift justice, because the ledger shows this illegal transaction. Nobody can change the ledger. You\u2019re done. So, it turns out that things like Bitcoin or Ethereum are probably the last technology that you want to use for doing anything illegal, because they are public \u2014 the ledger is public. Figure 15: Blockchain Transactions are Transparent People talk about this and it gets a lot of press, just like Bitcoin gets a lot of press. Oh well, there\u2019s some Colonial pipeline ransomware and stuff like that. That will continue to go on. But there\u2019s a bigger issue here that there are some cryptos that are truly anonymous [19]. This issue is not just an issue with cryptocurrency, but it is an issue in general. We have our encrypted apps where we can send messages that nobody else can see, or we can talk or do a video completely encrypted. That also potentially enables terrorism or illegal activity, which is a bigger issue than blockchain, and it\u2019s a mistake to just focus on some of the illegal activity. I asked my students what they think the proportion of one-hundred-dollar bills in terms of all the US currency actually is, and they\u2019re thinking well, maybe 10% or 15%. It is 79%. And nobody has one. If you try to go to a store and pay with a hundred-dollar bill, they\u2019re not going to take it. So where are those hundred-dollar bills? El Chapo. So, this criticism is largely a false criticism, nevertheless, it is discussed in public, we have to deal with that because it\u2019s kind of a media-friendly story. But again, we need to look beyond. For any new technology, there will be some costs, so this might be one of the costs. But you need to weigh that with the benefits, and the benefits are VERY substantial. This is, again, like a revolution. And I feel that my academic colleagues that are studying banking, and there\u2019s a large number of academics that are in that field, are really missing something big. For those that go to traditional banks for their jobs, I tell them, go there, and then the first day you\u2019re there, you should be looking to jump to the next job, because there isn\u2019t a long-term future for you in traditional banking. And it really comes down to what I said at the beginning of our talk, that this is a revolution, and you have the opportunity to be part of it, or, be swept away by it. William: Thank you, Prof. Harvey! I think it\u2019s a great response to the risk factors, and I really like how the benefits outweigh the risks in decentralized finance. I think your insights are really valuable for us, especially the young people in our audience at Duke and DKU. I believe that our conversation today will inspire more people to think more about DeFi and even work on it. Thank you again for joining the interview today! Prof. Harvey: Great, thank you for inviting me.","title":"Question 5"},{"location":"articles/AMA/HowwillDeFiReshapetheFutureofFinance/#relevant-materials","text":"[1] Barter System In trade, barter is a system of exchange in which participants in a transaction directly exchange goods or services for other goods or services without using a medium of exchange.

About the Interviewees Introduction to Dylan Paul: Figure 1: Dylan Paul Dylan is a rising Junior at Duke University majoring in Computer Science with a concentration in Machine Learning and minoring in Finance. He is extremely passionate about blockchain technology as well as Decentralized Finance. This summer, he has been working on the Decentralized Finance Team as part of the CS+ program through Duke. As part of this team, he has learned the MOTOKO language as well as the DFINITY architecture to construct an AAVE-like decentralized lending protocol on the Internet Computer. With this application, he hopes to conduct research comparing the reverse gas model to the gas model as seen on Ethereum. Introduction to Malika Rawal: Figure 2: Malika Rawal Malika is a rising Sophomore at Duke University studying economics and computer science. She is very interested in the fintech area and has really enjoyed learning about decentralized finance through Duke CS+\u2019s \u201cDecentralized Finance on the Internet Computer\u201d research team. They are learning about utilizing Dfinity\u2019s Internet Computer to build decentralized lending programs, specifically those replicating concepts from Liquity and Compound Aave. She is working with her research partner, Dylan Paul, on replicating Aave and they have created their own project called ICy (Internet Computer Yield). With this application, she hopes to conduct research comparing liquid democracy and governance on the Internet Computer and Ethereum.

So now we have some questions for you as you\u2019re the researchers in that project. So the first question is that we know that you\u2019ve joined the Duke CS+ program and are working on a project named ICy related to the Internet Computer [1] and distributed finance [2]. Can you please give us a brief introduction to your project, including its expectations and objectives? Malika: ICy stands for Internet Computer yield, and it is a decentralized lending protocol for the Internet Computer. Our inspiration was Aave, which is already on the Ethereum Blockchain, We were trying to follow it in some ways by creating a similar protocol on the Internet Computer, so we did utilize some information from there. In general, that\u2019s the main project that we\u2019ve been working on this semester, but we\u2019ve also been working on our own research projects that we\u2019ve used to improve ICy as well. Figure 3: Decentralized lending protocol Dylan: I think, just to build off that, they\u2019re really two sides to this project. We\u2019ve been working on the research side and the innovation side. For the research side, we all had to come up with our own individual topic but based on the application that we were building, which for us was ICy. And my particular research was targeted towards comparing and analyzing the Ethereum gas model to Dfinity\u2019s Internet Computer\u2019s reverse gas model [3] which is really just a fancy way of saying that I\u2019m comparing how transaction fees are working for developers and users on both of these blockchain technologies, and trying to see how these fees affect users and developers economic decisions. So the innovation side enables us to make these comparisons because we were recreating a decentralized lending protocol that resembles Ethereum\u2019s [4] AAVE. This means that we\u2019re recreating a decentralized bank protocol with lending and borrowing of crypto assets on the Internet Computer. The name of this application is ICy which stands for Internet Computer Yield, and it will be used to compare the gas models more effectively on both of these platforms. Questions 2 Zesen: Thank you so much. Just as you mentioned, unlike most of the theoretical learning that takes place in the university, the project you have been working on is such an integrated activity combining research and technical practice. So could you please briefly talk about your incentives for starting this project and did this project help you with your studies and your future career? Dylan: I think for me, I was personally passionate about blockchain technology in general as I\u2019ve interacted with Ethereum and Aave [5] and the decentralized applications on their platform. So I thought that this would be a good project to get myself into to start to understand what else is out there in the field. But also, in particular, on Ethereum, a huge problem that they have is the gas fees [6]. And as someone that\u2019s a student, I can\u2019t afford to spend so much money on every single transaction that I make. So, I thought it would be really interesting to compare how the gas model differs on Ethereum\u2019s and the Internet Computer\u2019s blockchains. So I think that was my motivation for coming up with that research question and analyzing the difference in the lending protocols, which is what is mostly used on Ethereum. Figure 4: dApps Malika: Similarly, I am an economics and finance student who is also interested in computer science. So I wanted to come in and learn more about the economic side of blockchain and to know what the companies are doing, you can only really know that if you\u2019ve understood the blockchain technologies. So in the past, I\u2019ve invested in various cryptocurrencies but I never even knew how they worked. So I thought this research opportunity would be a good way to see the background of these blockchain companies and understand what\u2019s going on behind the scene. For example, what happens in the background when a company has a pitfall, and what is going on when there is an increase in the crypto\u2019s price. So I think this is a perfect project for me because of my interest in both economics and computer science. When we picked what research we wanted to do, I started with the chain and key technology [7], but it was a little bit too broad, because it\u2019s a massive project to handle on IC, so we would take a whole new semester to do. So I narrowed it down to more of the Network Nervous System [8], and then liquid democracy. So right now my research paper is on comparing liquid democracy between Ethereum and the Internet Computer so that we can better handle ICy and find a better implementation for it. Questions 3 Xinyu: Thank you so much, it\u2019s so nice to see that you\u2019re motivated by your interest and you\u2019re still in progress in what you like. So, two months into the CS+ Project, can you give us a brief overview of how the project is processing so far, like Malika has mentioned a little bit about that, and do you have significant achievements among your project that you can share with us. Dylan: I think the biggest achievements that we\u2019ve had came on the backend side recently. We\u2019ve been working on the frontend development to make it look a little bit prettier but the backend was initially difficult to get functioning. Due to the novelty of the Internet Computer, there is not that much documentation out there so learning the language, the syntax and the system was difficult. So I think it is an achievement that we were able to build something that resembles a typical lending protocol. Our ICy protocol enables users to lend and earn interest for providing liquidity, as well as borrow if the users provide enough collateral. There is still more functionality that we can continue to add, but we currently have it working properly for two users. The application also has the ability to scale to more users, but we are keeping it simple for now with two users whose funds we can manually control, which is important for experimentation purposes and therefore our research questions and analysis. So I think the fact that we have a backend that functions as a lending protocol is pretty impressive considering what we were initially given in terms of very little information on what Dfinity really was or the Internet Computer. Malika: I agree. I think the backend is definitely the most important part and just learning the language throughout two months is a little bit hard to pick up on because there\u2019s not that much documentation online There are barely any examples out there using Motoko [9] or similar languages on the Internet Computer. Figure 5: Motoko Programming Language So that would definitely be the biggest one. And then recently I am working on the frontend, we have a baseline nature, and we\u2019re working on integrating the two sides so that we can have it become user compatible. As of right now, we have a front-end demo that can be used to submit grant proposals or advertise our product. It has the main page where a user can play around with the functions, an about page where they can learn about the development of ICy, as well as a developers page where they can learn about the developers, professors, mentors, and research supporters. Also, understanding how to dive in and create specific comparisons in research has been difficult as well. From this summer, I\u2019ve learned a lot about how to do research in economics and computer science and how to pick a specific variable to compare in a study. Questions 4 Zesen: I totally understand your pain on the Motoko part because I also write code in this language which lacks documentation. And the last question is also about this field. Say that you are working in a completely new field and the technology stack you are using is very new, such as the Motoko programming language, etc. And relatively speaking, these technologies often do not have a very mature ecology, which means that information retrieval can be very difficult. Have you encountered similar problems in your research and how did you solve them? Dylan: For sure, I mean we hit a pretty big roadblock for a little while and we didn\u2019t really know where to turn. We actually consulted Dfinity engineers at one point by reaching out on their developer forum. But it still just wasn\u2019t easy just because of how new the Internet Computer is and there\u2019s no documentation like you said to really draw inspiration from. So we Figure d it out as best as we could and we just continued to tinker, which is, in my opinion, often the best way to Figure it out, so we just kept on trying and trying. And actually the last couple of nights, we\u2019ve kind of moved from what we had originally to scaling it up a little bit by creating a database type system [10] that holds users\u2019 accounts and information, and that kind of overrode some of the problems that we were experiencing earlier. So we\u2019re trying to Figure out how to get around those problems that we couldn\u2019t really Figure out at first by trial and error as well as approaching the problem from a different angle. Figure 6: Debug Malika: Coming from a research standpoint, I think in the beginning, we all picked research topics not really thinking about how to implement them in our code. So some of us had Chain Key Technology, others had reverse gas fee models, orthogonal persistence, there were others as well, but we never really discussed utilizing those concepts to develop similar solutions in our own code. After realizing that was the main intent of the research, we narrowed our research down and focused more on how it can help us with developing ICy . In our research paper, you\u2019ll see a part about how we implement our research on project ICy So that was important because research should go hand in hand with our product.

It gives you control and visibility over your money. It gives you exposure to global markets and alternatives to your local currency or banking options. DeFi products open up financial services to anyone with an internet connection and they\u2019re largely owned and maintained by their users. So far tens of billions of dollars worth of crypto have flowed through DeFi applications and it\u2019s growing every day.

The NNS is hosted within the network itself and is part of the system of protocols that securely weaves together the compute capacity of node machines to create the Internet Computer blockchain network, allowing the network to be autonomous and adaptive. The NNS acts as an autonomous \u201cmaster\u201d blockchain with a public key to validate all ICP transactions. Website [9] Motoko Motoko is a programming language that is designed to seamlessly support the programming model of the Internet Computer, making it easier to efficiently build applications and take advantage of some of the more unique features of the platform. Motoko is strongly typed, actor-based, and has built-in support for orthogonal persistence and asynchronous message passing. Productivity and safety features include automatic memory management, generics, type inference, pattern matching, and both arbitrary- and fixed-precision arithmetic. Messaging transparently employs the Internet Computer\u2019s Candid interface definition language and wire format for typed, high-level, and cross-language interoperability. Website [10] Type System In programming languages, a type system is a logical system comprising a set of rules that assigns a property called a type to the various constructs of a computer program, such as variables, expressions, functions, or modules. These types formalize and enforce the otherwise implicit categories the programmer uses for algebraic data types, data structures, or other components (e.g. \u201cstring\u201d, \u201carray of float\u201d, \u201cfunction returning boolean\u201d).

It has the main page where a user can play around with the functions, an about page where they can learn about the development of ICy, as well as a developers page where they can learn about the developers, professors, mentors, and research supporters. Also, understanding how to dive in and create specific comparisons in research has been difficult as well. From this summer, I\u2019ve learned a lot about how to do research in economics and computer science and how to pick a specific variable to compare in a study.","title":"Questions 3"},{"location":"articles/AMA/ICy%3AADecentralizedLendingProtocolontheInternetComputer/#questions-4","text":"Zesen: I totally understand your pain on the Motoko part because I also write code in this language which lacks documentation. And the last question is also about this field. Say that you are working in a completely new field and the technology stack you are using is very new, such as the Motoko programming language, etc. And relatively speaking, these technologies often do not have a very mature ecology, which means that information retrieval can be very difficult. Have you encountered similar problems in your research and how did you solve them? Dylan: For sure, I mean we hit a pretty big roadblock for a little while and we didn\u2019t really know where to turn. We actually consulted Dfinity engineers at one point by reaching out on their developer forum. But it still just wasn\u2019t easy just because of how new the Internet Computer is and there\u2019s no documentation like you said to really draw inspiration from. So we Figure d it out as best as we could and we just continued to tinker, which is, in my opinion, often the best way to Figure it out, so we just kept on trying and trying. And actually the last couple of nights, we\u2019ve kind of moved from what we had originally to scaling it up a little bit by creating a database type system [10] that holds users\u2019 accounts and information, and that kind of overrode some of the problems that we were experiencing earlier. So we\u2019re trying to Figure out how to get around those problems that we couldn\u2019t really Figure out at first by trial and error as well as approaching the problem from a different angle. Figure 6: Debug Malika: Coming from a research standpoint, I think in the beginning, we all picked research topics not really thinking about how to implement them in our code. So some of us had Chain Key Technology, others had reverse gas fee models, orthogonal persistence, there were others as well, but we never really discussed utilizing those concepts to develop similar solutions in our own code. After realizing that was the main intent of the research, we narrowed our research down and focused more on how it can help us with developing ICy . In our research paper, you\u2019ll see a part about how we implement our research on project ICy So that was important because research should go hand in hand with our product.","title":"Questions 4"},{"location":"articles/AMA/ICy%3AADecentralizedLendingProtocolontheInternetComputer/#relevant-materials","text":"[1] Internet Computer Developed by DFINITY Foundation, the Internet Computer extends the functionality of the public Internet so that it can host backend software, transforming it into a global computing platform.

He is currently focusing on two research topics: 1. Robust and efficient design of blockchain protocols. 2. Efficient privacy-preserving computation. Questions 1 Xinyu: What is your motivation for doing research about cryptography and blockchain? Figure 2: Blockchain & privacy Prof. Nayak: Preserving data privacy and trust decentralization. We have been moving to use the cloud more and more in the last couple of decades. This has resulted in privacy concerns for our own data. Also, in the last 15\u201320 years, we have increasingly moved to being privacy-aware. That brings my interest in applied cryptography and more specifically in privacy-preserving computation. With respect to blockchain, the idea behind it is to decentralize trust. Currently, you are placing trust in a small number of parties, which may be individual companies or financial institutions. In an ideal world, you may not want to trust one or a few numbers of parties, and you may want to decentralize it as much as possible, provided that you can have all of the benefits that you have in a centralized world. So far as you can keep the benefits the same and you can reduce the amount of trust. Questions 2 Xinyu: Can you briefly highlight your research in the field of Fintech or blockchain? Prof. Nayak: In terms of blockchains, my focus has been primarily on designing better consensus protocols [8]. As you know, in blockchains, you decentralize trust by having multiple parties instead of one. If you have multiple parties doing the same job for you, it is essential for them to agree on whatever they\u2019re doing. So, if you are executing a smart contract, like a bank executing a check or a post-dated check, you\u2019re writing a smart contract, which is a program that does the same as what a post-dated cheque would do. But now it is not one institute that you\u2019re trusting: you have a group of parties all of whom are doing the same thing. This agreement problem has been known for the last 40 years. It started with Leslie Lamport , Shostak, and Pease [9 ] and it was called the Byzantine Generals Problem [10]. There have been protocols that have existed for a long time. Then you\u2019re trying to do this at scale for every small transaction, e.g., for every payment, at that point, it becomes critical that we have systems that can, on the one hand, be efficient, and on the other, can tolerate a large number of faults. Figure 3: The Byzantine Generals\u2019 Problem So, looking at different realistic models under which you can actually achieve this, is something that has been my focus. Recently, one of the streams that I worked on is the following: when research started in this space, there were these two assumptions that people made: one is called consensus in the presence of asynchrony [11] , and the other is called consensus in the presence of synchrony [11] . The key difference between the two is whether messages arrive within a certain amount of time or not. Under asynchrony, you cannot tolerate any faults if you have deterministic protocols. There were many papers that came up and spoke about using synchrony and good network conditions. But these papers were not very much for practical use, they were fairly theoretical. The research since then, so this is from the 1980s until, maybe I would say 2010 or 2015, has been in the partially synchronous setting. Going back, when they learned that you cannot do anything with deterministic asynchronous protocols, people went two routes: use a randomized asynchronous protocol or come up with a notion that is intermediate between synchrony and asynchrony?\u201d And all of the research in the space has evolved to use these modeling assumptions. One of the most known assumptions is the pBFT or practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance [12] , which was by Barbara Liskov [13] and Miguel Castro in the year 2000. There are better practical variants of these protocols in the same model but the number of faults they can tolerate is few. You can only tolerate one-third of Byzantine faults. There are lower bounds to say you cannot do any better. But in an ideal world when you want to tolerate as many faults as possible. So, I think the change happened actually with Bitcoin where Bitcoin assumed synchrony and still made things work. While most people thought of synchrony as being impractical, Bitcoin said, well, you can have a system that works in practice. There were many other things that Bitcoin was doing, but that was one of those assumptions. This goes back to the 2016 or 2017 timeframe when we went back and said well Bitcoin assumes synchrony, whereas all of the practitioners assume asynchrony in practice. Figure 4: Demystifying Cryptocurrency One of my streams of research that I focused on is to go back and see what can you do with synchronous protocols. The advantage is clear: instead of targeting one-third Byzantine fault, I can tolerate minority collusion of 49% faults, which is great. But the question is, you still go back and keep asking those questions: \u201cIs it practical? What does it take to make it practical?\u201d For instance, with synchrony, the difference is that my protocol needs to know how much time it takes for a message to be sent, and this time-bound is fixed, known and no message should break it apart. If I say it takes one second for my message to reach, even if one message breaks, my output will slow for just one minute. So all bets are off, that can be terrible. If you just design a regular synchronous protocol without taking into consideration these things, they could happen once in a while, and then you do not have safety. What can we do to make it work under worse network conditions? What if there is a small degree of asynchrony for whatever definition of small degree that we can achieve while ensuring that we can still tolerate Byzantine faults? I think that has been one key area of focus of my research among others. Questions 3 William: How do you think the Internet Computer can possibly empower your research? What support do you need to innovate with Internet Computer? If you have any technical questions for Dfinity engineers, you can also ask and we may refer your questions to Dfinity engineers for more conversation. Figure 5: DFINITY Internet Computer Prof. Nayak: Figure 6: Regulation of Decentralized Application I think my questions will be more generic, not specifically for Dfinity but definitely applicable to Dfinity as well. It is always nice to say we want decentralized trust. But I think understanding what it means in practice and how it matters, so you know how this decentralization matters may be the key. For example, one of the key uses that are touted in the blockchain is this idea in supply chain management [14]: if I have blockchains I have a better degree of protection compared to doing it in a centralized way. The question is: Can we precisely show the advantage of using a blockchain? The question is, in many of these use cases where we say we want decentralization, do we really, really, really need decentralization? Or it is just acting as a catalyst towards changing the system? Are we just asking for a different system temporarily and 10 years later we will move back to a centralized system again because it has many advantages? So long story short, I want to ask what are the three killer use cases that you think can be solved by an Internet computer. Well, if I ask you to compare Dfinity to, let\u2019s say Ethereum, that may be actually an easier comparison. Because one can just say I can give you better performance, and so on. I think the comparison point to me is between Dfinity Internet Computer and the centralized system today. If you say you need the decentralized application, why do you need it and, what are the three killer applications that will be useful? And for these applications what are the requirements? Do you need blockchain or do you need something else that may not require all of the features of blockchain? As a simple example, for payments, bitcoin uses consensus, and many of these consensus protocols use consensus. You agree, and then you do payments. So recently there has been a sequence of works, They say if all you want to maintain is these payments, you actually don\u2019t need consensus as a stepping stone. You can achieve this without an ordered sequence of transactions. There are ways of doing it, so the question is, do you need what you\u2019re building and why do you need it? William: Thank you, Professor, that\u2019s really great insight and a very sharp question that we will ask the Dfinity engineers and we really appreciate your answering our questions, and we really appreciate the introduction and inside you provide us today. Thank you! That\u2019s all for our interview. Relevant Materials [1] Privacy-preserving computation Secure multi-party computation (also known as secure computation, multi-party computation (MPC), or privacy-preserving computation) is a subfield of cryptography with the goal of creating methods for parties to jointly compute a function over their inputs while keeping those inputs private. [Wikipedia] [2] Secure processor A secure cryptoprocessor is a dedicated computer-on-a-chip or microprocessor for carrying out cryptographic operations, embedded in a packaging with multiple physical security measures, which give it a degree of tamper resistance . Unlike cryptographic processors that output decrypted data onto a bus in a secure environment, a secure cryptoprocessor does not output decrypted data or decrypted program instructions in an environment where security cannot always be maintained. [Wikipedia] [3] Obvious computation An oblivious computation is one that is free of direct and indirect information leaks, e.g., due to observable differences in timing and memory access patterns. [Cornel University] [4] I/O efficiency I/O-efficient algorithms are algorithms designed in a two-level external memory (or I/O-) model, where the memory hierarchy consists of the main memory of limited size M and external memory (disk) of unlimited size; the goal is to minimize the number of times a block of B consecutive elements is read (or written) from (to) disk (an I/O-operation, or simply I/O). [Madalgo] [5] Bandwidth The maximum amount of data transmitted over an internet connection in a given amount of time. [Verizon] [6] Locality In computer science , locality of reference, also known as the principle of locality, is the tendency of a processor to access the same set of memory locations repetitively over a short period of time. There are two basic types of reference locality \u2014 temporal and spatial locality. Temporal locality refers to the reuse of specific data and/or resources within a relatively small time duration. Spatial locality (also termed data locality) refers to the use of data elements within relatively close storage locations. Sequential locality, a special case of spatial locality, occurs when data elements are arranged and accessed linearly, such as traversing the elements in a one-dimensional array . [Wikipedia] [7] RAM Random-access memory (RAM) is a form of computer memory that can be read and changed in any order, typically used to store working data and machine code . A random-access memory device allows data items to be read or written in almost the same amount of time irrespective of the physical location of data inside the memory, in contrast with other direct-access data storage media (such as hard disks , CD-RWs , DVD-RWs , and the older magnetic tapes and drum memory ), where the time required to read and write data items varies significantly depending on their physical locations on the recording medium, due to mechanical limitations such as media rotation speeds and arm movement. [Wikipedia] [8] Consensus Protocols In addition to cryptography and P2P (peer-to-peer) technology, consensus protocols are also a fundamental part of blockchain technology. A good consensus protocol can guarantee the fault tolerance and security of the blockchain systems. The consensus protocols currently used in most blockchain systems can be broadly divided into two categories: the probabilistic-finality consensus protocols and the absolute-finality consensus protocols. [ICT Express] [9] Leslie Lamport Leslie B. Lamport (born July 2, 1941) is an American computer scientist . Lamport is best known for his seminal work in distributed systems , and as the initial developer of the document preparation system LaTeX and the author of its first manual. Leslie Lamport was the winner of the 2013 Turing Award for imposing clear, well-defined coherence on the seemingly chaotic behavior of distributed computing systems, in which several autonomous computers communicate with each other by passing messages. He devised important algorithms and developed formal modeling and verification protocols that improve the quality of real distributed systems. These contributions have resulted in improved correctness, performance, and reliability of computer systems. [Wikipedia] [10] Byzantine Generals Problem The Byzantine Generals Problem is a term etched from the computer science description of a situation where involved parties must agree on a single strategy in order to avoid complete failure, but where some of the involved parties are corrupt and disseminating false information or are otherwise unreliable. [CoinCentral] [11] Consensus in the presence of asynchrony and consensus in the presence of synchrony In the standard distributed computing model, the communication uncertainty is captured by an adversary that can control the message delays. The communication model defines the limits to the power of the adversary to delay messages. There are three basic communication models: the Synchronous model, the Asynchronous model, and the Partial synchrony model. In the Synchronous model, there exists some known finite time-bound \u2206. For any message sent, the adversary can delay its delivery by at most \u2206. In the Asynchronous model, for any message sent, the adversary can delay its delivery by any finite amount of time. So, on the one hand, there is no bound on the time to deliver a message but, on the other hand, each message must eventually be delivered. [Decentralized Thoughts] [12] Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance is a consensus algorithm introduced in the late 90s by Barbara Liskov and Miguel Castro. pBFT was designed to work efficiently in asynchronous(no upper bound on when the response to the request will be received) systems. It is optimized for low overhead time. Its goal was to solve many problems associated with already available Byzantine Fault Tolerance solutions. Application areas include distributed computing and blockchain. [GeeksforGeeks] [13] Barbara Liskov Barbara Liskov (born November 7, 1939, as Barbara Jane Huberman) is an American computer scientist who is an Institute Professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Ford Professor of Engineering in its School of Engineering \u2019s electrical engineering and computer science department. She was one of the first women to be granted a doctorate in computer science in the United States and is a Turing Award winner who developed the Liskov substitution principle . [Wikipedia] [14] Supply Chain Management Supply chain management is the management of the flow of goods and services and includes all processes that transform raw materials into final products. It involves the active streamlining of a business\u2019s supply-side activities to maximize customer value and gain a competitive advantage in the marketplace.

[Wikipedia] [7] RAM Random-access memory (RAM) is a form of computer memory that can be read and changed in any order, typically used to store working data and machine code . A random-access memory device allows data items to be read or written in almost the same amount of time irrespective of the physical location of data inside the memory, in contrast with other direct-access data storage media (such as hard disks , CD-RWs , DVD-RWs , and the older magnetic tapes and drum memory ), where the time required to read and write data items varies significantly depending on their physical locations on the recording medium, due to mechanical limitations such as media rotation speeds and arm movement. [Wikipedia] [8] Consensus Protocols In addition to cryptography and P2P (peer-to-peer) technology, consensus protocols are also a fundamental part of blockchain technology. A good consensus protocol can guarantee the fault tolerance and security of the blockchain systems. The consensus protocols currently used in most blockchain systems can be broadly divided into two categories: the probabilistic-finality consensus protocols and the absolute-finality consensus protocols.

Lamport is best known for his seminal work in distributed systems , and as the initial developer of the document preparation system LaTeX and the author of its first manual. Leslie Lamport was the winner of the 2013 Turing Award for imposing clear, well-defined coherence on the seemingly chaotic behavior of distributed computing systems, in which several autonomous computers communicate with each other by passing messages. He devised important algorithms and developed formal modeling and verification protocols that improve the quality of real distributed systems. These contributions have resulted in improved correctness, performance, and reliability of computer systems. [Wikipedia] [10] Byzantine Generals Problem The Byzantine Generals Problem is a term etched from the computer science description of a situation where involved parties must agree on a single strategy in order to avoid complete failure, but where some of the involved parties are corrupt and disseminating false information or are otherwise unreliable. [CoinCentral] [11] Consensus in the presence of asynchrony and consensus in the presence of synchrony In the standard distributed computing model, the communication uncertainty is captured by an adversary that can control the message delays. The communication model defines the limits to the power of the adversary to delay messages. There are three basic communication models: the Synchronous model, the Asynchronous model, and the Partial synchrony model. In the Synchronous model, there exists some known finite time-bound \u2206. For any message sent, the adversary can delay its delivery by at most \u2206. In the Asynchronous model, for any message sent, the adversary can delay its delivery by any finite amount of time. So, on the one hand, there is no bound on the time to deliver a message but, on the other hand, each message must eventually be delivered. [Decentralized Thoughts] [12] Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance is a consensus algorithm introduced in the late 90s by Barbara Liskov and Miguel Castro. pBFT was designed to work efficiently in asynchronous(no upper bound on when the response to the request will be received) systems. It is optimized for low overhead time. Its goal was to solve many problems associated with already available Byzantine Fault Tolerance solutions. Application areas include distributed computing and blockchain.

As a crucial element of the program, the debate series brings talented researchers into discussions and debates on a broad range of topics, especially within economics and science. SciEcon debate embodies the philosophical evolvement from thesis to antithesis and finally resides in syntheses. Moreover, to boost empathy which we believe is the cornerstone of every civil society, each scholar must switch sides, debating against and for the same argument. Thus, SciEcon debate is not for competition but to present a unique opportunity, especially for aspiring young scholars, to reason from various perspectives, engage in inspiring conversations, and reach a consensus for collaborating projects. \u2014 - Prof. Luyao Zhang At the end of this article, we had an interview with Prof. Dr. Yulin Liu . He has a background in quantum computation and monetary theory. Yulin has led economics and governance design at Dfinity, Origyn, Liquity, and Distrikt. As a monetary theorist and crypto economist, he will compare the Internet Computer with Ethereum from three perspectives: Economics, Governance, and Applications. Figure 1: The debate content: Yin and Yang \u00a9SciEcon 2021 1. Opening Remarks Tianyu Wu : Ethereum is a decentralized, open-source blockchain with smart contract functionality . Ether is the native cryptocurrency of the platform. After Bitcoin, it is the s econd-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization . Nowadays, Ethereum hosts DeFi Applications for crowdfunding, financial services, identity management, and gambling, which led to the creation of new products and services that can improve different areas of our lives, such as Non-fungible tokens and decentralized autonomous organizations. More than that, many academic researchers show their interest and have managed to analyze its privacy, design, safety, stability, implementation issues, opportunities it provides, and the future hurdles we envisage. Francesco Cavallero: The debate will look at Ethereum from the three facets of Applications, Economics, and Governance to portrait the fairest representation of the current blockchain scenario. Starting from an application perspective, our debaters will explore how developers can quickly build new interactive applications on Ethereum and the risks associated with its composability feature. Our debate teams will then evaluate multiple economic incentives, such as access to information and transaction costs, that can be pivotal in the widespread adoption of Ethereum. Lastly, our debaters will attempt to reach a consensus about the underlying governance of Ethereum by considering different features like transparency and decentralization. 2. Debating Session 1: Thesis Perspective 1 (Application) Pro: Lewis Tian : Ethereum excels in composability , meaning developers can build applications on the platform and interact with other applications without permission. Moreover, to become a developer for decentralized applications, you don\u2019t have to start from scratch. For example, Uniswap, a decentralized exchange, has already written smart contracts capable of handling tokens waps, upon which are the building blocks that developers can build. The composability provided by Ethereum has brought together a community of developers, fostering creativity and cooperation. Past hackathons have shown us some of the brightest ideas, thanks to composability. Therefore, the composability of Ethereum serves as the foundation of the cross-industry revolutions brought by Ethereum. Con: Fiona Li : The composability without permission comes with costs. The first cost is smart contract risk; it can be subject to contract bugs. So in the future, we might have centralized insurance companies hiring professionals to review the code to ensure the security of smart contracts ( Ljxie. 2019, 2019 ). The second cost is limited scalability . Since the system is permissionless, we have more and more people joining the network; Then, the infrastructure part cannot keep up with the complexity of the network. The Ethereum network is processing around 15 transactions per second (TPS) with over thirty dollars gas fee per transaction, which is slow and expensive, making it uneconomical for people to use the platform. Perspective 2 (Economics) Pro: Ray Zhu: Ethereum smart contract has significant advantages in its rule-based mechanism \u00b9, adaptability, and automation that corrects irrational human behaviors. Ethereum contracts can be equipped with information collectors that help trend the market movements in a more accurate way, as suggested by the efficient market theory. The trading strategies built inside facilitates saving investors\u2019 time and costs, avoiding behavioral biases (e.g., herd psychology, overconfidence, anchoring effect, representativeness, etc.), and maximizing profits. On the one hand, its efficiency and intellectuality make short-term arbitrage feasible by transacting financial assets at the most appropriate time. On the other hand, smart contracts objectively and imperturbably make the decision by sticking to the code-law and circumventing human investors\u2019 erratic emotions and irrationality. Figure 2: 8 Behavioral biases that may hurt your investments Con: Ziqiao Ao\uff1a Rule-based mechanism restricts the subjective initiative of investors\u2019 behavior and overcomes emotional investment behaviors. Although relying on standard economic models and advanced algorithms, rule-based smart contracts do not necessarily ensure prediction accuracy since they are likely to omit unquantifiable factors such as overall market sentiment. Besides, rule-based mechanisms also possess substantial risks. Once the system has bugs or gets hacked, there is no person in charge of taking responsibility and responding with a remedy, making the consequences often more severe and irreparable than those caused by manual operation. Perspective 3 (Governance) Pro: Saad Lahrichi: Ethereum\u2019s most attractive feature is its off-chain governance system, originally designed with a decentralized ethos, first promulgated by Satoshi Nakamoto . The strength of off-chain governance lies in the ability of Ethereum users to propose protocol updates through EIPs (Ethereum Improvement Proposals) \u00b2. The various stakeholders: miners, developers, and users, express their approval or disapproval of the EIP. When the stakeholders reach a consensus, the protocol changes take place. If not -which is usually the case- the core developers either revoke the EIP or hard fork the protocol and keep features they think are necessary. Hard forks would result in a permanent split into two separate networks that run in parallel ( Liu, 2020 ), ( Zoltu, 2021 ), ( ethereum.org ). The ability to perform hard forks -an operation possible only under off-chain governance systems- is another strength of Ethereum. For example, to remediate the DAO hack of 2017, the core developers performed a hard fork that essentially returned the stolen funds to their owners ( Folk, 2017 ). Without off-chain governance, this would not have been possible. Cons: William Zhao The current framework of EIP lacks transparency and decentralization in decision-making. The technical bar of proposing EIP is high, and the decision-making on whether and why to accept an EIP draft is particularly vague and centralized. The six editors of EIP appointed by the Ethereum Foundation bring the EIPs to the discussion in the All Core Developers Meeting, who then decide the fate of an EIP with no clarified rules. This governance model is called off-chain governance. As Ethereum transforms to its 2.0 version, we will see increasing controversies over the EIPs between users, developers, and miners. The imbalance of voting power can lead to protests from disadvantaged groups. There might also be factors that bias core developers\u2019 decisions, including self-interest, pressure from the governments, bribes, and lobbying. 3. Debating Session 2: Antithesis Perspective 1 (Application) Pro: Fiona Li: Interoperability , the ability of computer systems to exchange information and value, brings us creative cross-industry applications ( Engineers, n.d. ). For example, Brian Flynn (2019) shares his concept of integrating Stablecoin Dai into the populous Pac-Man game . In the new game, Stablecoin DAI is the reward for an excellent dots collection. However, if the player\u2019s dots collection is smaller than 80 percent, DAI is leftover for the next player. Another cross-industry example is PoolTogether which incorporates lotteries with DeFi . People purchase lottery tickets, and all funds from ticket purchases earn interest through the Defi protocol Compound. Everyone gets their funds back at the end of the lottery, but one winner gets all of the interest earned on the pooled money, so it is essentially a \u201cno-loss\u201d lottery ( PoolTogether n.d. ). There are other amazing cross-industry applications: The 21OO project, for instance, applies DeFi to social media. Figure 3: Pac-Man Game Pac-Man is one of the longest-running, best-selling, and highest-grossing video game franchises in history; it has seen regular releases for over 40 years, has sold nearly 48 million copies across all platforms, and has grossed over US$14.107 billion, most of which has been from the original arcade game. Con: Lewis Tian: The recent sensation around Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) is a prime example of an Ethereum-enabled cross-industry application. An NFT is a unique cryptocurrency token that can take the form of almost anything digital. The most popular standards for NFTs are ERC-721, the first standard for representing non-fungible digital assets, and ERC-1155, both on the Ethereum blockchain. Unsurprisingly, Ethereum is currently the leading blockchain service for NFT issuance. However, securing NFTs requires enormous mining power by nature of the proof-of-work system. Ethereum mining consumes 26.5 terawatts per year, equivalent to the electricity consumption of Ireland ( Somvichian-Clausen 2021 ). With numerous popular cross-industry applications (e.g., NFTs) built on or facilitated by Ethereum, their cumulative environmental impact is inevitably becoming more concerning than ever. Perspective 2 (Economics) Pro: Ziqiao Ao: Ethereum gains excellent advantages in its permissionless \u2074 financial network . Ethereum provides inclusive financial services to anyone in the world with an internet connection by leveraging open-source software. This trustworthy inclusion enables people around the world that are unbanked to join the modern world of Internet commerce. Users could remain anonymous when entering the network. They could make transactions with anyone with a meager transaction fee, incentivizing more investors to participate in network activities. Besides, miners could receive incentives in the form of a mining reward once winning the competition to find a block that satisfies a condition that requires considerable computational effort. All these significantly promote the circulation of the platform currency, and the dynamic balance between supply and demand was realized, thus encouraging sustainable development . Con: Ray Zhu: Due to the low entry barrier and anonymity, Ethereum smart contracts\u2019 permissionless characteristics also bring network vulnerabilities and ethical issues. Even worse, a decentralized system always makes it challenging to exert timely human intervention, as happened to the notoriously famous Dao hack in 2016. Stakeholders failed to prevent the hack of 3.6million ether just because they couldn\u2019t get the necessary votes promptly ( Siegel 2016 ). Moreover, the over-opening to the public also burdens the industry. Inclusiveness is good, but it also causes \u201ctraffic congestion.\u201d When the user scale transcends a certain critical point, marginal costs become larger than benefits. This side-effect of smart contracts results in an unhealthily expensive gas fee and the accumulation of useless data on the blockchain. Figure 4: Dao Hack Timeline Perspective 3 (Governance) Pro: William Zhao: I will now argue why the current off-chain governance model remains to be the most pragmatic one for Ethereum: First, technocracy brings the people who know Ethereum the best to decision-making, making the decision process more efficient and professional and the EIP themselves safer and more reliable. Moreover, the technocracy \u2075 of off-chain governance is better than the plutocracy \u2076 of on-chain governance. The on-chain governance relies on the governance tokens to execute voting, so the wealthy people or miners can influence decision-making, which will eventually exacerbate the inequality on blockchain and lead to centralization. Finally, off-chain governance will act more efficiently than on-chain governance. A case in point is the DAO Attack that happened in 2016 when the on-chain governance of DAO failed to respond effectively, the the off-chain governance of Ethereum succeeded in deterring the attack . Con: Saad Lahrichi: When the DAO hack happened, many people saw restoring people\u2019s money as the supreme goal, but others reasoned that Ethereum is a blockchain, thus immutable. The community should not have the means to overturn that principle, and on-chain governance is likely the better option for various reasons. First, the success and popularity of Ethereum make reaching consensus a prolonged process within the community to adopt a protocol change. The on-chain governance system would result in a much shorter turnaround time for decision-making ( Liu, 2020 ). What is more, if we think about EIPs as elections, then under the on-chain governance system, votes would not be counted equally, but rather, whoever holds more tokens, holds more voting power. The public knows what the voting rules are, and when consensus is reached, the changes are made automatically, without going through a centralized entity of the core developers. This results in a decentralized governance system, in which the community is the de facto \u2077 decision-makers, and hard-forks would hardly happen. ( ethhub.io ). The on-chain governance system ensures that the ecosystem benefits all stakeholders, and not just the core developers. 4. Conclusion: Synthesis Perspective 1 (Application) Pro: Lewis Tian : The composability of Ethereum reduces the friction of turning an idea into an actual application for the developers, and by doing so, benefits the general public for enjoying a variety of decentralized applications. This creativity that has been fostering in the community can facilitate more innovations. Applying decentralized applications to industries like game and art, we can better understand and revolutionize the marketplaces, creating new demands and benefiting different audiences by making the applications more accessible and exciting. Figure 5: Everydays: The First 5000 Days , the NFT art that sold for 69.3 million USD The major upgrade to Ethereum 2.0\u2078 will hopefully resolve the scalability and environmental issues by transitioning from PoW (proof-of-work) to PoS (proof-of-work). To mitigate smart contract risk, proactive defenses by building more robust implementation are essential. Still, it is also crucial to devise damage control strategies on Ethereum, where numerous DApps introduce unavoidable vulnerabilities that can minimize the loss incurred by the risks, to avoid turning a butterfly into a black swan ( Chen et al. 2019 ). Con: Fiona Li : The application of Ethereum had several cons, including the risk of smart contracts, scalability issues, and environmental impact. To relieve the tradeoff between permissionless characteristics and the risk brought to smart contracts, we can have centralized insurance companies hiring professionals to review the code to ensure that the smart contract goes well. Furthermore, to enhance scalability and reduce energy waste, the upgrade from PoW to PoS systems may broadly address the problems. In PoS, the mining power is not directly related to how powerful the hardware devices are but by the amount of Ether staked. Perspective 2 (Economics) Pro: Ray Zhu : Smart contracts are excellent for being permissionless and malleable. However, we are far from knowing whether AI investment could perform better than human investors or not. Once the smart contract is in effect, \u201cthe code is law,\u201d and the contract will automatically run once it meets the conditions. Hence, delegating to smart contracts in financial investment will sacrifice investors\u2019 coping flexibility and even amplify some systematic bugs or ethical issues. To evaluate the effect of AI investment, we propose the research question, \u201cwhether delegation to AI could perform better than human discretion in investment decisions?\u201d We are designing a behavioral experiment to answer this research question. Meanwhile, we will also investigate how personality affects delegation choice. Figure 6: Where delegation to AI could perform better than human discretion in investment decisions? Con: Ziqiao Ao : Regarding the economic side, the main concern for us is the security and the effectiveness of smart contracts. Responding to the call, we could establish a standard to assess smart contracts from the facets of ingrained security and transactions it bolstered . Moreover, it\u2019s also essential to evaluate the contribution of each smart contract to the involvement of the whole Ethereum network. In this endeavor, we could apply social network theories \u2079 to recover the dynamics of network features and simulate counterfactual results for comparison. By creating a comprehensive standard, we could mitigate risks and enhance efficiency by predicting transaction anomalies and providing a remedy in advance. Figure 7: ERC20 token UNI active addresses transaction network on 2021\u201303\u201320 \u00a9SciEcon 2021 Perspective 3 (Governance) Pro: William Zhao: We have debate off-chain governance , the so-called technocracy , against on-chain governance, the so-called plutocracy. But, of course, the ultimate goal is to achieve the desired outcomes of security, scalability, and efficiency altogether . But, unfortunately, neither of the current governance models is enough to solve the trilemma. Thus, it\u2019s crucial to develop the current models, or maybe an integrated model that can truly achieve desirable outcomes in a decentralized world. Con: Saad Lahrichi: On-chain governance seems like a fair, safe, and time-saving option. Fair : because it is a decentralized process. Safe : because it significantly reduces the possibility of a hard fork. Time-saving : because it drastically reduces turnaround times. However, on-chain governance might fail to reach consensus promptly when stakeholders largely disagree. \u201cTo be or not to be, it is a question.\u201d Figure 8: Hamlet Let me ask you, the readers: Do we want to keep Ethereum as it has been and trust developers to have the last word in decision-markings? Or, do we want to bring a fundamental change by adopting on-chain governance that gives power back to all stakeholders on the blockchain through decentralized, rule-based, and automated voting mechanisms? Interview For Prof. Yulin Liu: Can you briefly highlight how Internet Computer improves upon Ethereum in facets of Applications, Economics and Governance? Script : Prof. Zhang : Our debaters have been discussing the pros and cons, Yin and Yang of the Ethereum blockchain from the three perspectives of Economics, Governance, and Applications. However, we can see that there are so many we need to improve upon Ethereum blockchain. So, we know you have been working in the crypto space for several years and led economics and on-chain governance research at Dfinity. So, I\u2019m wondering whether you could share what are the exciting possibilities that the Internet Computer can bring to the blockchain industry. So, the first question is, from the perspective of Governance, how do you think the Internet Computer performs better than the Ethereum blockchain. Prof. Liu: Well, that\u2019s a great question. You know, first for Ethereum, it doesn\u2019t have an on-chain governance system yet. So now it\u2019s an off-chain governance system. And decisions are made by a small group of people, mostly the technical developers. The Internet Computer built by DFINITY Foundation is different in two perspectives. First, it has an on-chain governance system, a network nervous system, where everyone, or every token holder could submit proposals, and then everyone can vote. So that\u2019s the first difference. The Internet Computer has an on-chain governance. And Ethereum has an off-chain governance system. But I think Ethereum is transitioning into a proof of stake and on-chain governance system eventually, in the next few years. Prof. Zhang: Yeah, sounds great. However, in the previous discussion, our debaters have raised some problems or issues of the on-chain governance as well. For example, sometimes the absolute democracy, caused by the on-chain governance could include many people who are not experts to vote on the issue that they do not have expertise with. And in the end, it only leads to a worse outcome or cost delays when we should make very quick and prompt important decisions, where the experts have more expertise in. So how does the Internet Computer solve this problem? Prof. Liu: That actually comes to my second point of the major difference between the governance system of DFINITY and the governance system of Ethereum. So, of course, voting is costly. Voters need to spend time reading and doing research on these proposals that requires effort and also expertise. Actually, most token holders don\u2019t care about the voting power. They care more about the economic incentives than the voting power. On the Internet Computer, we have the so-called liquid democracy to solve this problem. The liquid democracy means voters could delegate their votes to experts, so they will follow automatically the vote of these experts. It is called liquid democracy, because these voters could withdraw the delegation at any time if they are not happy with the voting results of these experts. This is our argument of another advantage of the Internet Computer. Prof. Zhang: Yeah, it looks promising. The second question is, from the perspective of Economics, how do you think the Internet Computer improves upon Ethereum blockchain? Prof. Liu: I think there are several major differences when we talk about token economics of DFINITY and Ethereum. The first one is who is going to pay the transaction fees. On Ethereum, it\u2019s users who pay the transaction fee. As a user, whenever you send a transaction, no matter if it\u2019s a transfer of your tokens from one address to another address, or it\u2019s a call for some smart contracts, it costs you something. This is the gas fee. This is actually quite a pain for users: for every operation you do on Ethereum, you need to pay money. And this is different from the traditional internet space. Nowadays, when you use LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, you open your account, you post something, you retweet, you share, you upload photos, this is free. This is what users get used to nowadays. For Ethereum, I would say that\u2019s the point that prevents Ethereum from broader adoption. And on the Internet Computer, we are different in the sense that it\u2019s not users paying, but the canisters paying. Canisters on the Internet Computer are similar to the smart contracts on Ethereum. Here, canisters are preloaded with gas tokens called CYCLE. As a developer of the canister, you need to preload the canister with a certain amount of CYCLE tokens. And users could use your canister or your smart contract frictionlessly without paying any fee. So, that\u2019s one major difference. I would say that\u2019s one major advantage of the canisters-pay model. Prof. Zhang: Yeah, it sounds like the Internet Computer makes the economy much more inclusive by lowering the market barriers, especially since we know that for each individual user, there might be many people who are not able to have a very large number of transactions. So if each time they need to pay the fees for the transaction that would really increase market friction. However, if this burden is transferred to the provider or supplier side, it could be much easier because they have more sources to get funding and solve this problem. Sounds great. So what else? Prof. Liu: Right. I would say there are of course many economic advantages. The second thing that comes to my mind is the dual token system. On Ethereum, it has only one token, one native token. It\u2019s ETH. And users for every operation they conduct on Ethereum network, they need to pay gas. And the gas price is measured in ETH. And ETH price is very volatile, which makes the transaction fee very volatile. Today, if I transfer some tokens to you, it will cost me $1. And tomorrow it would cost me $10. This is not friendly for people doing business on Ethereum. On the Internet Computer, we solve this problem by creating a dual token system. We have our native token called ICP token. This is like ETH. And then we have the second token called CYCLE. Anyone could burn the ICP token into our stable coin, CYCLE. And CYCLE is pegged to SDR, a special drawing rights at IMF International Monetary Funds. This consists of a basket of sovereign currencies. So, this is relatively stable, and CYCLE is relatively stable. All the gas fees are measured in CYCLEs. And since CYCLE is a stable coin, you can precisely predict how much it costs for you to do any operation: to create a smart contract, to transfer tokens, or to use any applications deployed on the Internet Computer. To wrap up, I would say the two major advantages are: first, it\u2019s canisters-pay model, not users pay; Secondly, it has a dual token system. Prof. Zhang: Yeah, those are very cool features. Last but not the least, I think what many people would care the most about is how the Internet Computer would bring true sense to the new user experiences when they are using all kinds of applications in daily life. How do you think? Prof. Liu: Yeah, I would say, let\u2019s look at this from the macro perspective. The first decentralized blockchain project is Bitcoin. Bitcoin is a very simple system. Basically, you can only do transfers: you send tokens from address A to address B. And then a few years later, in 2015, Ethereum was developed. Ethereum is a smart contract platform, but it is too slow. It has problems with scalability, throughput and latency. That\u2019s very bad for the user\u2019s experience. That\u2019s why, now as you see, on Ethereum there are mostly DeFi projects. You can hardly deploy a decentralized LinkedIn, a decentralized TikTok, or a decentralized Facebook on Ethereum, because it\u2019s too slow and costly. Now, with the Internet Computer developed by DFINITY, everything is possible: you can deploy a decentralized LinkedIn, a decentralized Facebook, a decentralized Twitter that are not possible on Ethereum, at a very low price. Prof. Zhang: Wow, that\u2019s really exciting! So really thank you for the time today. And I guess everyone is now getting very excited that one day they could use the applications of all the new features on the Internet Computer.

As a crucial element of the program, the debate series brings talented researchers into discussions and debates on a broad range of topics, especially within economics and science. SciEcon debate embodies the philosophical evolvement from thesis to antithesis and finally resides in syntheses. Moreover, to boost empathy which we believe is the cornerstone of every civil society, each scholar must switch sides, debating against and for the same argument. Thus, SciEcon debate is not for competition but to present a unique opportunity, especially for aspiring young scholars, to reason from various perspectives, engage in inspiring conversations, and reach a consensus for collaborating projects. \u2014 - Prof. Luyao Zhang At the end of this article, we had an interview with Prof. Dr. Yulin Liu .

Moreover, to become a developer for decentralized applications, you don\u2019t have to start from scratch. For example, Uniswap, a decentralized exchange, has already written smart contracts capable of handling tokens waps, upon which are the building blocks that developers can build. The composability provided by Ethereum has brought together a community of developers, fostering creativity and cooperation. Past hackathons have shown us some of the brightest ideas, thanks to composability. Therefore, the composability of Ethereum serves as the foundation of the cross-industry revolutions brought by Ethereum. Con: Fiona Li : The composability without permission comes with costs. The first cost is smart contract risk; it can be subject to contract bugs. So in the future, we might have centralized insurance companies hiring professionals to review the code to ensure the security of smart contracts ( Ljxie. 2019, 2019 ). The second cost is limited scalability . Since the system is permissionless, we have more and more people joining the network; Then, the infrastructure part cannot keep up with the complexity of the network. The Ethereum network is processing around 15 transactions per second (TPS) with over thirty dollars gas fee per transaction, which is slow and expensive, making it uneconomical for people to use the platform.","title":"Perspective 1 (Application)"},{"location":"articles/AMA/OnEthereum%3AYinandYang/#perspective-2-economics","text":"Pro: Ray Zhu: Ethereum smart contract has significant advantages in its rule-based mechanism \u00b9, adaptability, and automation that corrects irrational human behaviors.

The trading strategies built inside facilitates saving investors\u2019 time and costs, avoiding behavioral biases (e.g., herd psychology, overconfidence, anchoring effect, representativeness, etc.), and maximizing profits. On the one hand, its efficiency and intellectuality make short-term arbitrage feasible by transacting financial assets at the most appropriate time. On the other hand, smart contracts objectively and imperturbably make the decision by sticking to the code-law and circumventing human investors\u2019 erratic emotions and irrationality. Figure 2: 8 Behavioral biases that may hurt your investments Con: Ziqiao Ao\uff1a Rule-based mechanism restricts the subjective initiative of investors\u2019 behavior and overcomes emotional investment behaviors. Although relying on standard economic models and advanced algorithms, rule-based smart contracts do not necessarily ensure prediction accuracy since they are likely to omit unquantifiable factors such as overall market sentiment. Besides, rule-based mechanisms also possess substantial risks. Once the system has bugs or gets hacked, there is no person in charge of taking responsibility and responding with a remedy, making the consequences often more severe and irreparable than those caused by manual operation.","title":"Perspective 2 (Economics)"},{"location":"articles/AMA/OnEthereum%3AYinandYang/#perspective-3-governance","text":"Pro: Saad Lahrichi: Ethereum\u2019s most attractive feature is its off-chain governance system, originally designed with a decentralized ethos, first promulgated by Satoshi Nakamoto . The strength of off-chain governance lies in the ability of Ethereum users to propose protocol updates through EIPs (Ethereum Improvement Proposals) \u00b2. The various stakeholders: miners, developers, and users, express their approval or disapproval of the EIP. When the stakeholders reach a consensus, the protocol changes take place. If not -which is usually the case- the core developers either revoke the EIP or hard fork the protocol and keep features they think are necessary. Hard forks would result in a permanent split into two separate networks that run in parallel ( Liu, 2020 ), ( Zoltu, 2021 ), ( ethereum.org ). The ability to perform hard forks -an operation possible only under off-chain governance systems- is another strength of Ethereum. For example, to remediate the DAO hack of 2017, the core developers performed a hard fork that essentially returned the stolen funds to their owners ( Folk, 2017 ). Without off-chain governance, this would not have been possible. Cons: William Zhao The current framework of EIP lacks transparency and decentralization in decision-making. The technical bar of proposing EIP is high, and the decision-making on whether and why to accept an EIP draft is particularly vague and centralized. The six editors of EIP appointed by the Ethereum Foundation bring the EIPs to the discussion in the All Core Developers Meeting, who then decide the fate of an EIP with no clarified rules. This governance model is called off-chain governance. As Ethereum transforms to its 2.0 version, we will see increasing controversies over the EIPs between users, developers, and miners. The imbalance of voting power can lead to protests from disadvantaged groups. There might also be factors that bias core developers\u2019 decisions, including self-interest, pressure from the governments, bribes, and lobbying.","title":"Perspective 3 (Governance)"},{"location":"articles/AMA/OnEthereum%3AYinandYang/#3-debating-session-2-antithesis","text":"","title":"3. Debating Session 2: Antithesis"},{"location":"articles/AMA/OnEthereum%3AYinandYang/#perspective-1-application_1","text":"Pro: Fiona Li: Interoperability , the ability of computer systems to exchange information and value, brings us creative cross-industry applications ( Engineers, n.d. ). For example, Brian Flynn (2019) shares his concept of integrating Stablecoin Dai into the populous Pac-Man game . In the new game, Stablecoin DAI is the reward for an excellent dots collection. However, if the player\u2019s dots collection is smaller than 80 percent, DAI is leftover for the next player. Another cross-industry example is PoolTogether which incorporates lotteries with DeFi . People purchase lottery tickets, and all funds from ticket purchases earn interest through the Defi protocol Compound. Everyone gets their funds back at the end of the lottery, but one winner gets all of the interest earned on the pooled money, so it is essentially a \u201cno-loss\u201d lottery ( PoolTogether n.d. ). There are other amazing cross-industry applications: The 21OO project, for instance, applies DeFi to social media. Figure 3: Pac-Man Game Pac-Man is one of the longest-running, best-selling, and highest-grossing video game franchises in history; it has seen regular releases for over 40 years, has sold nearly 48 million copies across all platforms, and has grossed over US$14.107 billion, most of which has been from the original arcade game. Con: Lewis Tian: The recent sensation around Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) is a prime example of an Ethereum-enabled cross-industry application. An NFT is a unique cryptocurrency token that can take the form of almost anything digital. The most popular standards for NFTs are ERC-721, the first standard for representing non-fungible digital assets, and ERC-1155, both on the Ethereum blockchain. Unsurprisingly, Ethereum is currently the leading blockchain service for NFT issuance. However, securing NFTs requires enormous mining power by nature of the proof-of-work system. Ethereum mining consumes 26.5 terawatts per year, equivalent to the electricity consumption of Ireland ( Somvichian-Clausen 2021 ). With numerous popular cross-industry applications (e.g., NFTs) built on or facilitated by Ethereum, their cumulative environmental impact is inevitably becoming more concerning than ever. Perspective 2 (Economics) Pro: Ziqiao Ao: Ethereum gains excellent advantages in its permissionless \u2074 financial network . Ethereum provides inclusive financial services to anyone in the world with an internet connection by leveraging open-source software. This trustworthy inclusion enables people around the world that are unbanked to join the modern world of Internet commerce. Users could remain anonymous when entering the network. They could make transactions with anyone with a meager transaction fee, incentivizing more investors to participate in network activities. Besides, miners could receive incentives in the form of a mining reward once winning the competition to find a block that satisfies a condition that requires considerable computational effort. All these significantly promote the circulation of the platform currency, and the dynamic balance between supply and demand was realized, thus encouraging sustainable development . Con: Ray Zhu: Due to the low entry barrier and anonymity, Ethereum smart contracts\u2019 permissionless characteristics also bring network vulnerabilities and ethical issues. Even worse, a decentralized system always makes it challenging to exert timely human intervention, as happened to the notoriously famous Dao hack in 2016. Stakeholders failed to prevent the hack of 3.6million ether just because they couldn\u2019t get the necessary votes promptly ( Siegel 2016 ). Moreover, the over-opening to the public also burdens the industry. Inclusiveness is good, but it also causes \u201ctraffic congestion.\u201d When the user scale transcends a certain critical point, marginal costs become larger than benefits. This side-effect of smart contracts results in an unhealthily expensive gas fee and the accumulation of useless data on the blockchain. Figure 4: Dao Hack Timeline","title":"Perspective 1 (Application)"},{"location":"articles/AMA/OnEthereum%3AYinandYang/#perspective-3-governance_1","text":"Pro: William Zhao: I will now argue why the current off-chain governance model remains to be the most pragmatic one for Ethereum: First, technocracy brings the people who know Ethereum the best to decision-making, making the decision process more efficient and professional and the EIP themselves safer and more reliable. Moreover, the technocracy \u2075 of off-chain governance is better than the plutocracy \u2076 of on-chain governance. The on-chain governance relies on the governance tokens to execute voting, so the wealthy people or miners can influence decision-making, which will eventually exacerbate the inequality on blockchain and lead to centralization. Finally, off-chain governance will act more efficiently than on-chain governance. A case in point is the DAO Attack that happened in 2016 when the on-chain governance of DAO failed to respond effectively, the the off-chain governance of Ethereum succeeded in deterring the attack . Con: Saad Lahrichi: When the DAO hack happened, many people saw restoring people\u2019s money as the supreme goal, but others reasoned that Ethereum is a blockchain, thus immutable. The community should not have the means to overturn that principle, and on-chain governance is likely the better option for various reasons. First, the success and popularity of Ethereum make reaching consensus a prolonged process within the community to adopt a protocol change. The on-chain governance system would result in a much shorter turnaround time for decision-making ( Liu, 2020 ). What is more, if we think about EIPs as elections, then under the on-chain governance system, votes would not be counted equally, but rather, whoever holds more tokens, holds more voting power. The public knows what the voting rules are, and when consensus is reached, the changes are made automatically, without going through a centralized entity of the core developers. This results in a decentralized governance system, in which the community is the de facto \u2077 decision-makers, and hard-forks would hardly happen. ( ethhub.io ). The on-chain governance system ensures that the ecosystem benefits all stakeholders, and not just the core developers.","title":"Perspective 3 (Governance)"},{"location":"articles/AMA/OnEthereum%3AYinandYang/#4-conclusion-synthesis","text":"","title":"4. Conclusion: Synthesis"},{"location":"articles/AMA/OnEthereum%3AYinandYang/#perspective-1-application_2","text":"Pro: Lewis Tian : The composability of Ethereum reduces the friction of turning an idea into an actual application for the developers, and by doing so, benefits the general public for enjoying a variety of decentralized applications.

Figure 5: Everydays: The First 5000 Days , the NFT art that sold for 69.3 million USD The major upgrade to Ethereum 2.0\u2078 will hopefully resolve the scalability and environmental issues by transitioning from PoW (proof-of-work) to PoS (proof-of-work). To mitigate smart contract risk, proactive defenses by building more robust implementation are essential. Still, it is also crucial to devise damage control strategies on Ethereum, where numerous DApps introduce unavoidable vulnerabilities that can minimize the loss incurred by the risks, to avoid turning a butterfly into a black swan ( Chen et al. 2019 ). Con: Fiona Li : The application of Ethereum had several cons, including the risk of smart contracts, scalability issues, and environmental impact. To relieve the tradeoff between permissionless characteristics and the risk brought to smart contracts, we can have centralized insurance companies hiring professionals to review the code to ensure that the smart contract goes well. Furthermore, to enhance scalability and reduce energy waste, the upgrade from PoW to PoS systems may broadly address the problems. In PoS, the mining power is not directly related to how powerful the hardware devices are but by the amount of Ether staked.","title":"Perspective 1 (Application)"},{"location":"articles/AMA/OnEthereum%3AYinandYang/#perspective-2-economics_1","text":"Pro: Ray Zhu : Smart contracts are excellent for being permissionless and malleable.

Hence, delegating to smart contracts in financial investment will sacrifice investors\u2019 coping flexibility and even amplify some systematic bugs or ethical issues.

Meanwhile, we will also investigate how personality affects delegation choice. Figure 6: Where delegation to AI could perform better than human discretion in investment decisions?

Responding to the call, we could establish a standard to assess smart contracts from the facets of ingrained security and transactions it bolstered . Moreover, it\u2019s also essential to evaluate the contribution of each smart contract to the involvement of the whole Ethereum network. In this endeavor, we could apply social network theories \u2079 to recover the dynamics of network features and simulate counterfactual results for comparison.

However, we can see that there are so many we need to improve upon Ethereum blockchain. So, we know you have been working in the crypto space for several years and led economics and on-chain governance research at Dfinity. So, I\u2019m wondering whether you could share what are the exciting possibilities that the Internet Computer can bring to the blockchain industry. So, the first question is, from the perspective of Governance, how do you think the Internet Computer performs better than the Ethereum blockchain. Prof. Liu: Well, that\u2019s a great question. You know, first for Ethereum, it doesn\u2019t have an on-chain governance system yet. So now it\u2019s an off-chain governance system. And decisions are made by a small group of people, mostly the technical developers. The Internet Computer built by DFINITY Foundation is different in two perspectives. First, it has an on-chain governance system, a network nervous system, where everyone, or every token holder could submit proposals, and then everyone can vote. So that\u2019s the first difference. The Internet Computer has an on-chain governance. And Ethereum has an off-chain governance system. But I think Ethereum is transitioning into a proof of stake and on-chain governance system eventually, in the next few years. Prof. Zhang: Yeah, sounds great. However, in the previous discussion, our debaters have raised some problems or issues of the on-chain governance as well. For example, sometimes the absolute democracy, caused by the on-chain governance could include many people who are not experts to vote on the issue that they do not have expertise with. And in the end, it only leads to a worse outcome or cost delays when we should make very quick and prompt important decisions, where the experts have more expertise in. So how does the Internet Computer solve this problem? Prof. Liu: That actually comes to my second point of the major difference between the governance system of DFINITY and the governance system of Ethereum. So, of course, voting is costly. Voters need to spend time reading and doing research on these proposals that requires effort and also expertise. Actually, most token holders don\u2019t care about the voting power. They care more about the economic incentives than the voting power. On the Internet Computer, we have the so-called liquid democracy to solve this problem. The liquid democracy means voters could delegate their votes to experts, so they will follow automatically the vote of these experts. It is called liquid democracy, because these voters could withdraw the delegation at any time if they are not happy with the voting results of these experts. This is our argument of another advantage of the Internet Computer. Prof. Zhang: Yeah, it looks promising. The second question is, from the perspective of Economics, how do you think the Internet Computer improves upon Ethereum blockchain? Prof. Liu: I think there are several major differences when we talk about token economics of DFINITY and Ethereum. The first one is who is going to pay the transaction fees. On Ethereum, it\u2019s users who pay the transaction fee. As a user, whenever you send a transaction, no matter if it\u2019s a transfer of your tokens from one address to another address, or it\u2019s a call for some smart contracts, it costs you something. This is the gas fee. This is actually quite a pain for users: for every operation you do on Ethereum, you need to pay money. And this is different from the traditional internet space. Nowadays, when you use LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, you open your account, you post something, you retweet, you share, you upload photos, this is free. This is what users get used to nowadays. For Ethereum, I would say that\u2019s the point that prevents Ethereum from broader adoption. And on the Internet Computer, we are different in the sense that it\u2019s not users paying, but the canisters paying. Canisters on the Internet Computer are similar to the smart contracts on Ethereum. Here, canisters are preloaded with gas tokens called CYCLE. As a developer of the canister, you need to preload the canister with a certain amount of CYCLE tokens. And users could use your canister or your smart contract frictionlessly without paying any fee. So, that\u2019s one major difference. I would say that\u2019s one major advantage of the canisters-pay model. Prof. Zhang: Yeah, it sounds like the Internet Computer makes the economy much more inclusive by lowering the market barriers, especially since we know that for each individual user, there might be many people who are not able to have a very large number of transactions. So if each time they need to pay the fees for the transaction that would really increase market friction. However, if this burden is transferred to the provider or supplier side, it could be much easier because they have more sources to get funding and solve this problem. Sounds great. So what else? Prof. Liu: Right. I would say there are of course many economic advantages. The second thing that comes to my mind is the dual token system. On Ethereum, it has only one token, one native token. It\u2019s ETH. And users for every operation they conduct on Ethereum network, they need to pay gas. And the gas price is measured in ETH. And ETH price is very volatile, which makes the transaction fee very volatile. Today, if I transfer some tokens to you, it will cost me $1. And tomorrow it would cost me $10. This is not friendly for people doing business on Ethereum. On the Internet Computer, we solve this problem by creating a dual token system. We have our native token called ICP token. This is like ETH. And then we have the second token called CYCLE. Anyone could burn the ICP token into our stable coin, CYCLE. And CYCLE is pegged to SDR, a special drawing rights at IMF International Monetary Funds. This consists of a basket of sovereign currencies. So, this is relatively stable, and CYCLE is relatively stable. All the gas fees are measured in CYCLEs. And since CYCLE is a stable coin, you can precisely predict how much it costs for you to do any operation: to create a smart contract, to transfer tokens, or to use any applications deployed on the Internet Computer. To wrap up, I would say the two major advantages are: first, it\u2019s canisters-pay model, not users pay; Secondly, it has a dual token system. Prof. Zhang: Yeah, those are very cool features. Last but not the least, I think what many people would care the most about is how the Internet Computer would bring true sense to the new user experiences when they are using all kinds of applications in daily life. How do you think? Prof. Liu: Yeah, I would say, let\u2019s look at this from the macro perspective. The first decentralized blockchain project is Bitcoin. Bitcoin is a very simple system. Basically, you can only do transfers: you send tokens from address A to address B. And then a few years later, in 2015, Ethereum was developed. Ethereum is a smart contract platform, but it is too slow. It has problems with scalability, throughput and latency. That\u2019s very bad for the user\u2019s experience. That\u2019s why, now as you see, on Ethereum there are mostly DeFi projects. You can hardly deploy a decentralized LinkedIn, a decentralized TikTok, or a decentralized Facebook on Ethereum, because it\u2019s too slow and costly. Now, with the Internet Computer developed by DFINITY, everything is possible: you can deploy a decentralized LinkedIn, a decentralized Facebook, a decentralized Twitter that are not possible on Ethereum, at a very low price. Prof. Zhang: Wow, that\u2019s really exciting! So really thank you for the time today. And I guess everyone is now getting very excited that one day they could use the applications of all the new features on the Internet Computer.","title":"Script:"},{"location":"articles/AMA/OnEthereum%3AYinandYang/#about-the-debaters","text":"Ziliang (Lewis) Tian (headshot left), Fiona (Jiayi) Li (headshot right) Ziliang (Lewis) Tian is a junior at Duke Kunshan University.

His recent research interests include the security, privacy, and scalability of decentralized systems, in particular those enabled by blockchains and trusted execution environments (TEEs). His works have been featured in Forbes, MIT Tech Review, IEEE Spectrum, CoinDesk, BitcoinMagazine, and numerous other blockchain news outlets. Several of his works have seen industry uptake. He received Ph.D. in Computer Science from Cornell University, advised by Prof. Ari Juels. He is a member of IC3 and a recipient of an IBM Ph.D. Fellowship for 2018\u20132020. He received B.Eng from Tsinghua University, China. In his separate capacity, he does research at Chainlink Labs. Watch our AMA interview for Prof. Fan Zhang on our YouTube channel , SciEcon. Read the Interview Scripts with annotations and citations. Question 1 Xinyu Tian: Professor Fan Zhang, we read your article about the DECO, a privacy-preserving oracle protocol, and CanDID , a platform for realizations of decentralized identities. We realize that communication security and internet identity security are currently hot topics in cryptography and distributed networks. Your research results will significantly impact the future direction of network security technologies. So, we appreciate your participation in your AMA interview session. Zesen Zhuang: We believe that your pioneering work will benefit the development of blockchain and fintech and inspire scholars researching this field. Let\u2019s get into our interview. Here is the first question. In your conference article , DECO, a privacy-preserving oracle protocol, and CanDID , you mentioned that some financial applications based on smart contracts would be difficult to implement without DECO. So how do you think blockchain and fintech like DECO will reshape how scholars do finance research and collaborate with practitioners? Prof. Fan Zhang: DECO essentially gives the ability to let smart contracts consume private data. For example, at DeFi [1] applications and particularly DeFi-based loans, if you want to take out a $100 loan, you need to put down a $200 collateral. This over-collateralization is economically inefficient. Figure 2: Crypto Loans The inefficiency comes from the difficulties of accessing credit history while protecting privacy. DECO overcomes the challenges by providing a privacy-preserving way to utilize financial records for risk assessments. Chainlink has licensed DECO. Our team is working on further developing DECO integrated DeFi Applications. Our work will revolutionize how people transact in DeFi. In my understanding, one of the fascinating things about working in this space is that industry and academia collaborate a lot. Professors are working with pioneers in the industry, and practitioners also care about academic research, which is rare in other disciplines. Prof. Luyao Zhang: Sounds very interesting! In Economics, professors start to collaborate more with practitioners in the area of Fintech. I\u2019m impressed to learn from you the exciting story: From the very start, computer scientists have a natural collaboration between academia and industry on the blockchain. That\u2019s very special! Prof. Fan Zhang: I think it\u2019s a scarce opportunity for researchers. I can name many startups founded by researchers and many firms that have licensed technology from universities. I feel particularly excited about how fast adoption can happen in the blockchain world. It\u2019s amazing. Question 2 Xinyu Tian: Thank you so much for sharing your ideas behind the DECO protocol and its potential application in the blockchain. It is exhilarating to hear about the rapid development of blockchain technology and the interdisciplinary research it stimulates. Here comes our second question: in your conference paper CanDID: Can-Do Decentralized Identity with Legacy Compatibility, Sybil-Resistance, and Accountability , you introduced the idea of empowering end-users with the management of their credentials, and you described CanDID as a platform for decentralized identity. What do you think about the current situation in cybersecurity in blockchain and decentralized systems? Prof. Fan Zhang: Just to clarify, I didn\u2019t invent those visions. Decentralized identity or self-sovereign identity [2] was an existing idea that kind of goes back to the early days of the Internet. Let\u2019s relate to your question: why does it happen now? Figure 3: Decentralized Identity The revolution comes from the emergence of new security and privacy technologies. The key technology that enables CanDID is blockchain technology , which has improved in recent years and advances in cryptography , among those especially believed to be impractical, such as multiparty computation [3], zero-knowledge proofs [4]. Those are expensive and powerful cryptographic tools. Until very recently, if you ask people about examples of MPC ( multiparty computation ), they will tell you that two millionaires want to compare who is more wealthy and don\u2019t want to reveal their net wealth to each other. People have been working on such abstract examples for years because large-scale deployment was not there yet. However, we have seen many advancements in this field in recent years, and CanDID benefits from those. With the powerful tools becoming more practical, we can build advanced systems such as CanDID and many more. The Great advancement in recent years in security and privacy technology enables all of this. Question 3 Zesen Zhuang: Thank you for sharing your ideas in the cybersecurity aspect, which is also the issue that Dfinity is facing in its Internet Identity service. The last question of this interview is about the internet computer itself. The Internet Computer is the first frictionless blockchain with web speed and internet-scale throughout the world. It extends the functionality of the public Internet so that it can host backend software, transforming it into a global computing platform. Do you think IC, or any other decentralized technology, can solve the Blockchain trilemma (decentralization, scalability, security)? How do you think the IC can empower the financial industry? Prof. Fan Zhang: I try not to discuss fluffy stuff like trilemmas because Blockchain solves the trilemma by making certain compromises. I don\u2019t know Dfinity well enough to comment specifically, but I don\u2019t think there\u2019s fundamentally an exception. I think the discussion of this type has to be more precise and more concrete. It\u2019s exciting to see new platforms like what Dfinity is launching and driving the development in that direction. Discussion Prof. Luyao Zhang: I\u2019m curious about your insights on the security part of the blockchain trilemma because you\u2019re an expert on it. For example, for the front-running [5] that we have discussed, it has been a historical problem in finance for years caused by intermediaries. Blockchain claims to cut intermediaries in financial transactions. I was astonished to know the front-running problem has again become a problem for the transactions on the blockchain. Is there any intuitive way that we could finally solve the front-running problem? I\u2019m not sure whether the Internet Computer is going to solve it. It seems they are using a new consensus algorithm, but how can we solve the front-running problem intuitively? Figure 4: Front Running Prof. Fan Zhang: That\u2019s an excellent question. Recently there have been heated discussions between practitioners and academia. The answer to your question depends on who you ask. There are generally two directions: Some believe front-running can be solved or minimized by building platforms with built-in \u201cfairness\u201d guarantees. First of all, we have front-running in the blockchain because you can think about the blockchain as a temporary centralized system. At a given time, only one miner is dictating the ordering of transactions. Some people believe that we can reduce front-running to a low level by building a \u201cfair\u201d consensus protocol. On the other hand, others claim that MEV is kind of fundamental. You can build new protocols, but new protocols will have unique problems and new front-running opportunities. Because fundamentally, whenever there is information asymmetry and temporary centralization, you will have parties with more power than others, which will lead to MEV. An entirely egalitarian system seems very hard to build, and some people believe that we can\u2019t solve the problem of front-running. In their views, we can democratize the opportunity for front-running attacks or extract MEV. Prof. Luyao Zhang: It sounds like an unsolvable question, and it\u2019s promising for us to work on it. Prof. Fan Zhang: I think it requires input from more than just computer science, and even defining the meaning of fairness is non-trivial, and we could write an entire paper just on that. Compared with the computer science point of view, the definition of fairness in finance and the economy is even more complex, especially if you want to realize it in a real-world system. Prof. Luyao Zhang: Yes, economists often disagree as well, and it would be a lot to say. I have one curious question as a user of the blockchain. The identity issue often puzzles us. Right now, we need to have physical tools like Yubikey for the computer or the blockchain to understand our identity. Figure 5: Yubikey So, we would worry that if we lost the key, we would lose everything. Then, maybe we don\u2019t have enough options to trust that our money on the blockchain is much safer than the current status quo. We might prefer protection from the police or the government so that when we lose the key to our bank account, we can have our ID reset. However, on the blockchain, we have to be our custodians. How do you feel about that? Prof. Fan Zhang: You\u2019re saying we\u2019re in trouble if we advertise self-custody of identity by securing a key, and we lose that key. We thought hard about this issue in the CanDID paper, and one of the goals is to solve this key management challenge in a usable way. Key management has been a decade-old problem since the birth of public-key cryptography. The problem is not new, but in the blockchain setting, the consequence is a lot more severe in that if you lose your key \u2014 you could lose a lot of money or even your identity. We had some ideas in that paper. For example, there are ways to build a key storage system where you can retrieve your keys. It\u2019s a balance between security and usability. The most useable way is that we have a centralized third party, and we give our keys to that party, and then that party will do the job of backing up the key and so on. We ask for the keys when we need them. That\u2019s what people essentially are doing when they store their bitcoin on Coinbase . Users don\u2019t have to manage the keys because Coinbase does so. The drawback is that you don\u2019t really have your keys and that third party could be malicious or could lose your key to attackers and so on. Therefore, the most \u201csecure\u201d version might be that you do your own thing. For example, what I do, which is simple, is print out the key on paper and store it in the safe. It\u2019s fascinating because keys are such a digital thing. But actually, one of the safest ways to keep it is to print them out and store them in the safe. In the CanDID paper, we talk about something in the middle, which is an excellent idea. It is the following: you don\u2019t need to trust a single third party because trusting a party might bring too much risk, but what about trusting three or five parties? For example, we split the secret into three pieces, and you store them at Google Drive , at Microsoft OneDrive , and GitHub . Then, if you want to retrieve the key, you authenticate to these services using your password. People are familiar with using passwords, and it\u2019s the same here. If you want to retrieve your key, you type your password and get back your key shares. The crucial difference is that you don\u2019t need to trust any single party but three of them altogether. Using the secret sharing technique, we can split the key into pieces so that you need the three parts to get back your secret, and any two pieces won\u2019t leak any information. That\u2019s the way we propose in CanDID, and it\u2019s not hard to implement. I think it\u2019s an amicable solution. I want to see people adopt our CanDID solutions. However, it seems that people are still at the two extremes . People who hold on to Coinbase for reasons. Coinbase has a big reputation that makes it a rational choice. However, we believe the tool for a middle-way solution is not hard to build and implement. We are curious how users will react when we make such a tool available. In conclusion, I think it\u2019s a complex question, and there are various trade-offs. Prof. Luyao Zhang: We want to try all the promising methods, which sounds very exciting. However, on the other hand, I found we are not at the stage yet where we don\u2019t need police anymore. Because otherwise, malicious guys can steal your safes. Then the safes are not safe anymore. Prof. Fan Zhang: Certainly. Prof. Luyao Zhang: Thank you, professor Fan Zhang, and this would be the end of our AMA interview session. Prof. Fan Zhang: Thank you for having me.

What is your motivation for doing research on fintech/blockchain? Prof. Xiong: 1.1 Decentralization empowers innovation by giving power back to individuals I think the spirit of blockchain is exciting. It is about decentralization. In this way, we can have more people, to have more freedom of creating value for the society without barriers. The standard systems sometimes become substantial obstacles for people who have talents and creative ideas. Big giants and the centralized system, the traditional ones like Tencent, can easily do innovations and creations. But the majority of people in the world are not part of giants like Tencent and they cannot easily innovate. I think that blockchain or FinTech can provide more freedom and power back to individuals. I was trained as a computer scientist more than fifteen years ago. My bachelor\u2019s and Ph.D. degrees are in computer science. My Ph.D. degree focused on grid computing, which is now called cloud computing. Back then in 2003, I was one of the first researchers in the area of decentralized systems and cloud computing. But the reason I changed my subject was that I found myself having a lot of ideas, but I just didn\u2019t have the resources, the funding, and the network to implement them. All of this requires a big network and a lot of resources, so I gave up on my own ideas and joined a business school where I can give advice to other people, but it\u2019s sad that I cannot do more on the technology side of innovation. However, I think that if we give more freedom and power back to people, the world will be much more innovative than today. 1.2 The spirit of Magna Carta: the past, present, and future of decentralization One of the recent things I did relevant to FinTech and blockchain is about a very important piece of history, the Magna Carta [1]. Magna Carta is the first great charter ever signed in the world. I\u2019m sure many people are familiar with the story: 25 noblemen (barons) kidnapped King John to the Magna Carta Island about 800 years ago, and forced him to sign the great charter. Figure 3: King John signing the Great Charter on the Magna Carta Island Eventually, this enabled the world to move forward since this is the first political power decentralization, giving power to a group of people and the parliament. That was the start of decentralization for political power. I\u2019m glad to say that my company acquired this island. As Chinese, we own this land. I think we should not only look at the history but also the future, how the Magna Carta spirit continues to influence society. I have been thinking about the decentralization of finance power. 800 years ago, we saw the decentralization of political power on this island, blockchain now enables us to decentralize finance power. Next, it will allow us to decentralize the technology power, so we don\u2019t want any more tech giants like Facebook and Alibaba. 2. Could you briefly highlight your research in the field of fintech/blockchain? Prof. Xiong: Research on Blockchain: Business value, Sustainable development, Fairness & Transparency I pay great attention to connecting theoretical research with practice. Now, 4 of the 6 Ph.D. students that I\u2019m supervising are focusing on the research related to blockchain, and we have interests in studying blockchain business models, for example, how to make blockchain valuable and profitable. However, we do not only keep our eyes on the business profits generated by blockchain but also what values it can contribute to society. In addition, we also did research on blockchain and social responsibility. As I mentioned earlier, the blockchain shares a similar spirit to the Magna Carta. Much of my research will focus on the blockchain and the Magna Carta. It\u2019s worth mentioning that I have already seen some research, which raises a point that the blockchain is like the Magna Carta for the Internet. Furthermore, I\u2019m also interested in the topic of blockchain and SDGs \u2014 sustainable development goals. There are 17 sustainable development goals [2] defined by the United Nations, and blockchain actually can contribute to every single goal of these 17 SDGs. So, on the one hand, I think my research mainly focuses on how blockchain can bring social fairness; on the other hand, from a business angle, to investigate how blockchain would improve the transparency of the supply chain and the integrity along the supply chain in the business world. 3. Blockchain undoubtedly replaces numerous inefficiencies in finance, but how do you see it promote the sustainable development of the finance industry? Prof. Xiong: Blockchain promotes financial transparency, inclusion, and equity Sustainable development means that the technology, no matter which sector it\u2019s in, contributes not only to the money but also to the environment and solving social issues. Providing financial support for poor people who really need it has always been a big issue because of corruption and the system. I think hundreds of millions of people don\u2019t even have a bank account, so how can they receive financial aid. Blockchain can actually enable the funding to reach the right people, people who really need it. And it is also good for anti-corruption which solves some social issues. Of course, we can track the transactions using blockchain technology, which provides better solutions to prevent money laundering. Therefore, central banks are creating their own digital currencies using blockchain technology. I also think that blockchain can solve the issue for SMEs and startups that they often have difficulty getting loans and financial support from banks because they get less credit, even though they may be really good companies. Providing finance to the right people/organization is what I believe to be very promising. 4. Your recent work [3] on the carbon footprint of Bitcoin demonstrates the environmental impact (E) of blockchain. Under the scope of conventional ESG, what Social and Governance implications, both risks, and opportunities, might blockchain have? Prof. Xiong: Opportunities and challenges coexist for blockchain Blockchain has very good potential for providing social fairness and justice and creating transparency to society as I mentioned in the previous question. It also provides an opportunity for a much better future. Normally, traditional technologies could not provide good opportunities and support people to be treated fairly in aspects like gender and ethnicity. But blockchain can not only track the transactions but also track the behaviors, so it provides solutions to traditional problems. However, as you said, there are huge risks created along with opportunities. If we talk about Bitcoin, it could be used for terrorism because it is not tracked. That\u2019s why central banks do not support Bitcoin. Also, money laundering. Since Bitcoin is not monitored, this sector can become wild and it can grow crazily. For example, the Bitcoin price increased ten times compared to last year, but of course, we saw a recent drop. But if a sector can rise so fast, this would change social value. That is why in my research I address carbon emission. The recent one you mentioned, published on Nature Communication, has been reported by more than 200 press. We call awareness from the society that Bitcoin does cause environmental issues. Figure 4: Top Bitcoin mining pools, from Prof. Xiong\u2019s Nature Communications article 5. Analogous to current ESG ratings for firms, what do you think of building a sustainability rating framework tailored to blockchains? What suggestions would you kindly offer if we were to construct such a sustainability evaluation method? Prof. Xiong: 5.1 A rating system for evaluating blockchain is significant and necessary I think that constructing an evaluation system for blockchain is important. I remember that one of my colleagues at the University of Surrey has several publications about blockchain for good, and he is one of the leading scientists in the area of how we can make good use of blockchain to serve society, which I believe is meaningful. Thus, the proposal you mentioned to construct a sustainability rating framework for the fintech firms and blockchain is necessary and significant. 5.2 Rating system construction with spirits analogous to Magna Carta spirit People regard blockchain as the Magna Carta for the Internet and technology. It can decentralize finance, technology and be beneficial for future development. As for the spirit of blockchain, similar to the spirit of the Magna Carta, is to create a fairer and more just society. Thus, we are happy to see if there is any measurement created, which can measure whether the blockchain applications can bring more liberty, fairness, justice, equality, transparency, and peace to people. Apart from those, the spirit of compromise can also be involved, which represents the need for people to communicate and understand each other. By achieving all these, we can eventually achieve the goal of sustainability. Therefore, I think it necessary to create such a rating system focusing on the degree to how a blockchain application serves the people (e.g. serving all the people or only serving a certain amount of people). We do not intend to create a blockchain where people on the top gain a large proportion of profits, but others are sacrificed. In China, we call it \u201ccut the leek\u201d, which means that using different systems to draw people\u2019s attention and let them pay, but only certain people can get profits in the end. 5.3 Rating elements: Power back to people, Equality, Positive impact on human behaviors It\u2019s also worth evaluating whether the technology can give power back to people. Let\u2019s take Facebook as an example: users store data on Facebook, but Facebook sells the database to other enterprises for big data analytics, like user behavior analysis. I think it is appropriate. Thus, we should give power back to the individuals (users), because the data should belong to them rather than centralized giants. Another point we can consider is whether the technologies can contribute to the equality of gender, rich and poor, race and ethnics. In addition, we could also consider the degree of positive impact, which a blockchain application generates on human behaviors. Let\u2019s take TikTok as an example, as people\u2019s behaviors have already changed, they spend days and days on this app, but it\u2019s not quite positive. Thus, it\u2019s significant to set a standard measuring how the application positively affects people\u2019s behavior, for instance, measuring the time people spend on certain applications. Taking this into consideration, only blockchains can track and provide transparent Figure s (data) for help. So, going back to the rating construction, I think we can first utilize the Magna Carta spirits. Since the Magna Carta is considered as a consensus, the blockchain also needs a consensus. For example, for bitcoin, without a consensus at the beginning, only a small proportion of people knew it and bought it. Gradually, with more and more people stepping in, they reach a consensus and then bitcoin has value. Similarly, blockchain applications should establish a consensus that most people accept in a positive way. Nowadays, there\u2019s a concept called \u201cSociety 5.0\u201d [4], and I\u2019m trying to push this concept to deliver the spirits of the Magna Carta. I hope that in the next stage of society, we can live in a fair and just world. 6. Comments on the Internet Computer by DFINITY [5] Prof. Xiong: 6.1 More focus on innovation, not implementation Internet Computer is certainly a very influential project by DFINITY, and I think the spirit of this project is very impressive. Figure 5: DFINITY launched the Internet Computer in May 2021.Learn more on DFINITY\u2019s official website When I was doing my Ph.D. 15 years ago, I focused on how to create a shared platform for more people and I created several applications on the cloud. I think this project can enable more people to access leading technologies. Also, DFINITY can make technology development easier. It is easier to develop using the coding language provided by DFINITY. So, people may focus more on what they want to do rather than what language they should learn. People should focus more on the creativity side rather than the implementation side. I believe this will change the future business models, especially technological ones. This will allow more people with less computer science skills to develop more applications that are valuable, and this can encourage people to focus on thinking and creating rather than funding for example. We don\u2019t need to hire like 20 developers for an idea, no, we do less such investment and focus on what we can do. We should spend less time on developing connections unless some people would like to of course. People who focus on creativity have less time for social (activities). Unfortunately, many people may have brilliant ideas, but they are not very good with social. Without social (activities), they cannot get resources to fund and support them. Thus, I believe this project, if it can be successful, which I think is very likely, will be very important infrastructure technology to support social development. 6.2 The transformative potential of Internet Computer Figure 6: Illustration of Society 5.0 As I mentioned earlier, society 5.0, I think the spirit of society 5.0 and I think the spirit of society 5.0 is very connected with DFINITY, that is to enable a more creative and innovative society. Currently, we have 5G technology, and later on, we may have 6G, which enables faster response and better remote operations, can make the Internet Computer more feasible and effective with more shared computing resources and more computing systems with greater transparency. I think the Internet Computer by DFINITY, if integrated with the things we discussed earlier like blockchain ratings and the Magna Carta spirit, can transform the world and create a more trusted computing world . Relevant Materials [1] Magna Carta What is the Magna Carta? The Magna Carta (\u201cGreat Charter\u201d) is a document guaranteeing English political liberties that was drafted at Runnymede , a meadow by the River Thames , and signed by King John on June 15, 1215, under pressure from his rebellious barons. By declaring the sovereign to be subject to the rule of law and documenting the liberties held by \u201cfree men,\u201d it provided the foundation for individual rights in Anglo-American jurisprudence . (Source: Britannica). The island where the Charter was signed is the Magna Carta Island as mentioned by Prof. Xiong. It is also the base of the World Peace and Sustainability Foundation where Prof. Xiong is one of the trustees.

I remember that one of my colleagues at the University of Surrey has several publications about blockchain for good, and he is one of the leading scientists in the area of how we can make good use of blockchain to serve society, which I believe is meaningful. Thus, the proposal you mentioned to construct a sustainability rating framework for the fintech firms and blockchain is necessary and significant. 5.2 Rating system construction with spirits analogous to Magna Carta spirit People regard blockchain as the Magna Carta for the Internet and technology. It can decentralize finance, technology and be beneficial for future development. As for the spirit of blockchain, similar to the spirit of the Magna Carta, is to create a fairer and more just society. Thus, we are happy to see if there is any measurement created, which can measure whether the blockchain applications can bring more liberty, fairness, justice, equality, transparency, and peace to people. Apart from those, the spirit of compromise can also be involved, which represents the need for people to communicate and understand each other. By achieving all these, we can eventually achieve the goal of sustainability. Therefore, I think it necessary to create such a rating system focusing on the degree to how a blockchain application serves the people (e.g. serving all the people or only serving a certain amount of people). We do not intend to create a blockchain where people on the top gain a large proportion of profits, but others are sacrificed. In China, we call it \u201ccut the leek\u201d, which means that using different systems to draw people\u2019s attention and let them pay, but only certain people can get profits in the end. 5.3 Rating elements: Power back to people, Equality, Positive impact on human behaviors It\u2019s also worth evaluating whether the technology can give power back to people. Let\u2019s take Facebook as an example: users store data on Facebook, but Facebook sells the database to other enterprises for big data analytics, like user behavior analysis. I think it is appropriate. Thus, we should give power back to the individuals (users), because the data should belong to them rather than centralized giants. Another point we can consider is whether the technologies can contribute to the equality of gender, rich and poor, race and ethnics. In addition, we could also consider the degree of positive impact, which a blockchain application generates on human behaviors. Let\u2019s take TikTok as an example, as people\u2019s behaviors have already changed, they spend days and days on this app, but it\u2019s not quite positive. Thus, it\u2019s significant to set a standard measuring how the application positively affects people\u2019s behavior, for instance, measuring the time people spend on certain applications. Taking this into consideration, only blockchains can track and provide transparent Figure s (data) for help. So, going back to the rating construction, I think we can first utilize the Magna Carta spirits. Since the Magna Carta is considered as a consensus, the blockchain also needs a consensus. For example, for bitcoin, without a consensus at the beginning, only a small proportion of people knew it and bought it. Gradually, with more and more people stepping in, they reach a consensus and then bitcoin has value. Similarly, blockchain applications should establish a consensus that most people accept in a positive way. Nowadays, there\u2019s a concept called \u201cSociety 5.0\u201d [4], and I\u2019m trying to push this concept to deliver the spirits of the Magna Carta. I hope that in the next stage of society, we can live in a fair and just world.","title":"5.

Figure 5: DFINITY launched the Internet Computer in May 2021.Learn more on DFINITY\u2019s official website When I was doing my Ph.D. 15 years ago, I focused on how to create a shared platform for more people and I created several applications on the cloud. I think this project can enable more people to access leading technologies. Also, DFINITY can make technology development easier. It is easier to develop using the coding language provided by DFINITY. So, people may focus more on what they want to do rather than what language they should learn. People should focus more on the creativity side rather than the implementation side. I believe this will change the future business models, especially technological ones. This will allow more people with less computer science skills to develop more applications that are valuable, and this can encourage people to focus on thinking and creating rather than funding for example. We don\u2019t need to hire like 20 developers for an idea, no, we do less such investment and focus on what we can do. We should spend less time on developing connections unless some people would like to of course. People who focus on creativity have less time for social (activities). Unfortunately, many people may have brilliant ideas, but they are not very good with social. Without social (activities), they cannot get resources to fund and support them. Thus, I believe this project, if it can be successful, which I think is very likely, will be very important infrastructure technology to support social development. 6.2 The transformative potential of Internet Computer Figure 6: Illustration of Society 5.0 As I mentioned earlier, society 5.0, I think the spirit of society 5.0 and I think the spirit of society 5.0 is very connected with DFINITY, that is to enable a more creative and innovative society.

Interview Video Question 1 William: With so many years of experience in studying and teaching econometrics, what do you think are some most important principles people should keep in mind when learning and using econometrics? What are some most commonly made mistakes? Prof. Wooldridge: That could be a very broad question, but I like the way you asked it in terms of basic concepts. I do think there is a tendency for students to jump ahead quickly to study measure theory, topology, other kinds of fancy math, thinking that those concepts are at the heart of modern econometrics. Don\u2019t get me wrong: those can be quite useful for theoretical econometrics research, but for understanding how the basic econometric methods work, it\u2019s really important to get a firm grounding in basic probability . Of course, after basic probability follows statistics. Much of our knowledge about regression analysis, for example, can be learned without looking at data first \u2014 understanding how one manipulates random variables and random vectors, understanding the notion of a linear projection and conditional expectations and how those get manipulated. That will actually take you pretty far for both linear analysis and the analysis of nonlinear models. Then, one does need to learn concepts like the standard limit theorems , such as the Law of Large Numbers and the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) [1], and along with those limit theorems come many ways to manipulate sequences of random variables and random vectors. Becoming very good at that, so that those manipulations become second nature, allows one to focus on the interesting aspects of econometrics such as coming up with a new estimator or applying an estimator to an interesting set of data and then actually understanding when the estimator will work and when it won\u2019t. That doesn\u2019t require such high-level math, but it does require constantly going back and making sure that you know you haven\u2019t missed anything and paying attention when you first study this material. Because we\u2019re sometimes eager to jump into data analysis without having the formal background to understand completely even a simple method that we take for granted, like ordinary least squares. I am still getting new insights into that method, even just working on some recent research, in fact. Question 2 Prof. Luyao Zhang: We know econometrics has many intersections with statistics or machine learning theory. What do you think is the fundamental difference between the methodology of econometrics and other similar sciences? How do you define the boundary econometrics? Prof. Wooldridge: This could be a controversial question because some people think that econometrics is just a subfield of statistics. I\u2019ve heard people even question why econometrics is a field. However, we are supposed to, and most of us do, have training in economics. Therefore, we are supposed to focus on topics that at least arise in some economic setting. Now I do think that because econometrics is studied by people who have Ph.D.s from economics departments, it is very similar to economics, and it really doesn\u2019t see any boundaries. If you think of economics as a discipline, perhaps it\u2019s a bit arrogant. However, we do tend to think that we can bring something to the analysis of almost every problem that involves people, firms, government agencies, and anything that involves interactions among units where there are incentives and outcomes. Therefore, this attitude has spilled over into econometrics as well, where we don\u2019t really think there are many boundaries in data analysis. A good example is the merging of machine learning with causal inference in econometrics over the past ten years. Machine learning methods started in statistics, which were largely used for prediction purposes. Econometricians have Figure d out how to modify those methods and use them for causal inference. I don\u2019t think there is any sense that some commission thinks this is out of boundary for us. The econometricians just say, \u201clook, we\u2019re interested in estimating the effects of policy interventions in causal analysis generally, and this is how these tools can be applied.\u201d I don\u2019t really see the boundary in terms of applied econometrics. All you have to do is to pick up one of either top five general purpose journals or look at the top field journals. Then, you will see topics ranging from criminology to health issues, where in some cases, you might think these would be things studied by epidemiologists or criminal justice people. Yet economists are involved in all of these. Look at what has happened with evaluating the effects of the coronavirus. Economists have been involved with that a lot and tried to Figure out what the economic costs are, even including what the psychological costs of the virus are, how effective things like lockdowns are, and so on. Therefore, I do not see many boundaries between economists and econometricians. Question 3 William: Your recent Econometrica paper ( Abadie et al. 2020 ) discusses an alternative way of interpreting standard errors in regressions as design-based uncertainty, in addition to the traditional sample-based uncertainty. Would you like to elaborate more on this paper? What does this result mean to the empirical researchers? When should we interpret standard errors in a design-based way, as suggested in the paper? Figure 3: Sampling-Based versus Design-Based Uncertainty in Regression Analysis Prof. Wooldridge: Thanks for this question. We\u2019re still working together on the paper, and we extend the initial work to the case where one might have to cluster the standard errors to account for either cluster sampling or some clustering in the design itself, the assignment of the treatment and the control groups. Then, we realized that we didn\u2019t actually fully understand the non-clustering case where we were taking random samples. We would think about not necessarily randomly assigning a policy, but where the assignment was independent across the units. This question used to come up to me. Occasionally, students would say, \u201cyou\u2019ve taught us how to analyze ordinary least squares [2], the asymptotic properties from the perspective of taking a random sample from the population, but what happens if you observe the entire population?\u201d, which is a great question because we often do, especially with aggregated data at the county level (e.g. counties, provinces). You see all of them. When you do any kind of econometric method like ordinary least squares (OLS), how do you interpret the standard errors that are reported? We decided to try to bridge this gap. There\u2019s been a long history in the design-based approach. The statisticians were involved many years ago and thought about having the population data. There\u2019s no sampling, but what you do have is that you have potential outcomes in both a control state and a treated state. Then, all the uncertainty comes through assigning units to the control or the treated. Now, the randomness comes from the situation where we only observe each unit in one state of the world. The way we assign the treatment is random. My books focus a lot on the random sampling case, so it seemed natural to try to come up with a framework to bring those two together. The framework provides a smooth transition from the case where you have random sampling from a large population all the way to the case where there\u2019s no sampling, and you observe the entire population. We manage to come up with a formula that covers all those cases. You can see explicitly that the formula for the proper variance depends on the fraction of the population that you observe. Therefore, one of the important insights that comes out of this is that if you observe the whole population and use the usual standard errors, they are conservative , so your confidence intervals are wider than they need to be in general. There are some cases where they\u2019re not conservative, when there is no underlying heterogeneity in the effects across people. There are cases where the usual heteroscedasticity-robust standard error, the so-called Eicker\u2013Huber\u2013White standard errors, are the right ones. But in general, they are conservative. Therefore, at least for now, if you have the whole population, you\u2019re using conservative errors. We actually have something in the paper that hasn\u2019t been applied as much, which is when you do observe the whole population or a significant fraction of the population, there\u2019s a way to adjust your standard errors to make them smaller. It\u2019s making them smaller in a legitimate way, because as you observe more of the population, the sampling error becomes less. Our paper shows exactly how the adjustment works, which is quite simple. Once somebody programs this up in Stata, I hope that it\u2019ll be used quite regularly. Moreover, there\u2019s some simple tricks to use it now based on using formulas from the stratified sampling literature, which also has a history in statistics. All of this research draws on lots of different fields, and it\u2019s becoming very interdisciplinary. Question 4 Prof. Luyao Zhang: In the past years, you have done much work improving our knowledge on some widely used econometric models, including instrument variables, difference-in-difference, and treatment effects ( S\u0142oczy\u0144ski and Wooldridge 2018 ; Wooldridge 2019 ; Wooldridge 2021 ). How do you think these new findings will influence the way empirical researchers apply these models? In which scenarios should we apply these new models? More generally, how do you think empirical researchers should learn about the latest econometric methods? Figure 4: Intuition of difference-in-difference Prof. Wooldridge: Of course, I hope empirical people would use my research regularly. You\u2019ve mentioned a few topics that I\u2019ve been working on, and I do continue to work on those. One of the methods that has become quite useful recently by combining methods from traditional treatment effects [3] with difference-in-difference [4] is the so-called doubly robust estimators that again have a history of statistics. I worked on this more than 15 years ago. I published a paper in 2007 in the Journal of Econometrics ( Wooldridge 2007 ) that proposed a particular kind of doubly robust estimator. If you\u2019re estimating a treatment effect, typically there are two approaches. Maybe more than two, but I will focus on two. You can use regression adjustment, which means you estimate models for the conditional mean of the outcome variable; You can use some propensity score method, which means you estimate a model for the treatment. It has been known for a while that you can combine those two to come up with an estimator which has a doubly robust property. The name is maybe not quite the right one, but it means that you only have to have one of the two models correct in order to consistently estimate the average treatment effect. That was derived in the context of cross-sectional analysis, but it turns out to be noticed by other researchers. And then something I\u2019m working on is that you can apply these robust methods to the panel data case as well, when you have difference-in-difference-type designs in a policy intervention. You have data before and after; you have a control group and a treatment group, and it turns out that you can apply this to even fairly complicated structures with staggered designs. You did mention the difference-in-difference work, so let me focus on what I\u2019ve actually written about. I think this is generally a good lesson that I showed you can use traditional regression methods . In particular, you can expand the usual two-way fixed effects estimator. Actually, it\u2019s not expanding the estimator, but expanding the model. My interpretation of the recent criticism of two-way fixed effects is that it\u2019s not a criticism of the estimator but a criticism of the model. The model assumes a single treatment effect, regardless of how many cohorts there are and how long the time period is for the intervention. And I simply noted that if you set things up properly, you can apply regression methods to estimate a much more flexible model, and this largely overcomes the criticisms of the simple two way fixed effects analysis. So, what I tried to emphasize with my students is that it\u2019s very important to keep separate the notion of a model and an estimation method . And I sometimes forget myself. I will say things like OLS model, but OLS is not a model. It\u2019s an estimation method which we can apply to various kinds of models. It\u2019s up to us to be creative and use the tools that we have so that we apply those methods to models that don\u2019t make strong assumptions. I hope that this idea bridges again a lot of my research, which is pretty simple. It\u2019s trying to find simpler ways to do more flexible analysis, at the point that it gets really hard. Question 5 William: On your Twitter, you criticized that machine learning is \u201crunning simulations until my new estimator looks notably better than existing estimators\u201d. Can you elaborate on your thoughts on how machine learning and other high-dimensional methods can improve in order to contribute to the field of economics and econometrics? Figure 5: Machine Learning Prof. Wooldridge: Posting on Twitter is a bit different than actually writing a serious research paper. But I was, of course, partly making a joke there because I was in the middle of doing some simulations for some recent nonlinear difference-in-differences methods that I\u2019ve been working on. But then I was thinking, as I was doing the simulations and changing the parameters of the simulations, am I doing this to learn about how this estimator compares with other estimators, or am I trying to rig it so that my estimator looks the best? So, I was really just making a statement. Like you know, it\u2019s human nature to want yours to be the best, right? One uses the machine to learn about that, and I\u2019m partly making a statement. I\u2019m trying to be as objective as I can by showing cases where the methods I\u2019m proposing work better but also being upfront about cases where other methods will work better. It\u2019s not completely unrelated to machine learning, though. When we publish papers, the best way to get your work published is to show that it works better than existing methods. Since the people writing the theory and deriving the methods are the same ones doing the simulations, it will probably be better if there\u2019s some disconnection there. We have some ways of objectively evaluating these methods now. If something becomes popular enough, others will evaluate it. But I think simulations are still needed to know about how something works in the real world. I\u2019ve always thought that we should have more competitions, such as blind competitions where people who participate don\u2019t know what the truth is. They apply their favorite method across a bunch of different scenarios, so we can evaluate how the different methods do. I\u2019m guessing that machine learning will come out pretty well with that, but that\u2019s an impression. I\u2019m not convinced that somebody using basic methods who has good intuition and is creative can\u2019t do as well. This does raise the issue of machine learning and its future. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve seen in your data analysis, where this has to have come up a fair amount. I think the work on applying machine learning methods to causal inference has guaranteed that it will have a long history in econometrics and other fields that use data analysis. When I took visits to campuses, Amazon, Google, they\u2019re using machine learning methods quite a bit. That\u2019s no secret. These companies are in the business of earning profits, and they\u2019re not going to employ methods that somehow aren\u2019t working for them. So, I think the market is certainly speaking on that. For prediction purposes, they seem to work very well. Reflections Prof. Luyao Zhang: Yes, sounds very interesting! Prof. Wooldridge points out promising directions for machine learning from just a prediction to find more scientific results. You can have machine learning plus causal inference. Zichao and Yufan are both from the data science major, so it will be great to hear their comments, especially those about the econometrics and machine learning. Yufan Zhang: Prof. Wooldridge\u2019s point about machine learning resonates with me as a data science student. The more I study some advanced machine learning models, especially deep learning models, the more I feel that it\u2019s unscientific. Many newly proposed models today are very functional and well-performed but also very complicated. Most of what the researchers are doing is just to try different models, such as adding different modules to the model. If the result of one structure doesn\u2019t work, they just try another one. So I think that\u2019s indeed the problem that the whole machine learning is, especially deep learning, is facing now. Prof. Jeffrey Wooldridge: It is a very good observation. Since I\u2019ve only dabbled in machine learning a bit, I don\u2019t have the experience that you have on how people are using it and progressing. Probably at the end, it\u2019s just like other econometric methods where people try a lot of different things, and they only report the one that gives the result that they want. So, perhaps machine learning hasn\u2019t saved us from that as much as we\u2019re being led to believe it. There is a bait. Just to follow up on that, I\u2019ve seen plenty of papers that jump right into the very difficult thing, which misses the low hanging fruit. In other words, there are simple ways to do things like causal inference. For example, one can estimate causal effects with instrumental variables to exploit the structure in ways that haven\u2019t been exploited before, instead of going fully to machine learning, the black box. It would be good if people try things that are easier to understand and then see if the more difficult thing produces similar answers or not. Zichao Chen: The world is changing rapidly. With the emergence of blockchain and many other information technologies, the problems in economics are becoming more complicated. What do you think is the trend of development in econometrics? Prof. Wooldridge: That\u2019s a really interesting and actually tough question for me. It\u2019s interesting that if you look at the literature on intervention analysis and difference-in-difference, in some ways we\u2019re trying to go back to simpler things. So, if you were to compare today with twenty years ago and see what econometrics people are doing, it seems to me that structural methods may be more out of favor now than they were fifteen years ago with this re-emergence of difference-in-difference. It seems that we are always looking for natural experiments and interventions to learn things about policy. If you have a lecture, and you have difference-in-difference in the title, or you offer a short course, immediately you will get a fairly large enrollment. But if you were offering a course on structural econometric methods in industrial organization, which is important, it seems to have a smaller audience. So, I wonder if our reaction to these complications in the real world is leading us to simplify the econometrics. Or, at least we are going to only believe analyses that have some clear way to identify the causal effect of an intervention rather than our relatively simple economic models.

What are some most commonly made mistakes? Prof. Wooldridge: That could be a very broad question, but I like the way you asked it in terms of basic concepts. I do think there is a tendency for students to jump ahead quickly to study measure theory, topology, other kinds of fancy math, thinking that those concepts are at the heart of modern econometrics. Don\u2019t get me wrong: those can be quite useful for theoretical econometrics research, but for understanding how the basic econometric methods work, it\u2019s really important to get a firm grounding in basic probability . Of course, after basic probability follows statistics. Much of our knowledge about regression analysis, for example, can be learned without looking at data first \u2014 understanding how one manipulates random variables and random vectors, understanding the notion of a linear projection and conditional expectations and how those get manipulated. That will actually take you pretty far for both linear analysis and the analysis of nonlinear models. Then, one does need to learn concepts like the standard limit theorems , such as the Law of Large Numbers and the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) [1], and along with those limit theorems come many ways to manipulate sequences of random variables and random vectors. Becoming very good at that, so that those manipulations become second nature, allows one to focus on the interesting aspects of econometrics such as coming up with a new estimator or applying an estimator to an interesting set of data and then actually understanding when the estimator will work and when it won\u2019t. That doesn\u2019t require such high-level math, but it does require constantly going back and making sure that you know you haven\u2019t missed anything and paying attention when you first study this material. Because we\u2019re sometimes eager to jump into data analysis without having the formal background to understand completely even a simple method that we take for granted, like ordinary least squares. I am still getting new insights into that method, even just working on some recent research, in fact.","title":"Question 1"},{"location":"articles/AMA/TheCurrentandFutureofEconometrics/#question-2","text":"Prof. Luyao Zhang: We know econometrics has many intersections with statistics or machine learning theory. What do you think is the fundamental difference between the methodology of econometrics and other similar sciences? How do you define the boundary econometrics? Prof. Wooldridge: This could be a controversial question because some people think that econometrics is just a subfield of statistics. I\u2019ve heard people even question why econometrics is a field. However, we are supposed to, and most of us do, have training in economics. Therefore, we are supposed to focus on topics that at least arise in some economic setting. Now I do think that because econometrics is studied by people who have Ph.D.s from economics departments, it is very similar to economics, and it really doesn\u2019t see any boundaries. If you think of economics as a discipline, perhaps it\u2019s a bit arrogant. However, we do tend to think that we can bring something to the analysis of almost every problem that involves people, firms, government agencies, and anything that involves interactions among units where there are incentives and outcomes. Therefore, this attitude has spilled over into econometrics as well, where we don\u2019t really think there are many boundaries in data analysis. A good example is the merging of machine learning with causal inference in econometrics over the past ten years. Machine learning methods started in statistics, which were largely used for prediction purposes. Econometricians have Figure d out how to modify those methods and use them for causal inference. I don\u2019t think there is any sense that some commission thinks this is out of boundary for us. The econometricians just say, \u201clook, we\u2019re interested in estimating the effects of policy interventions in causal analysis generally, and this is how these tools can be applied.\u201d I don\u2019t really see the boundary in terms of applied econometrics. All you have to do is to pick up one of either top five general purpose journals or look at the top field journals. Then, you will see topics ranging from criminology to health issues, where in some cases, you might think these would be things studied by epidemiologists or criminal justice people. Yet economists are involved in all of these. Look at what has happened with evaluating the effects of the coronavirus. Economists have been involved with that a lot and tried to Figure out what the economic costs are, even including what the psychological costs of the virus are, how effective things like lockdowns are, and so on. Therefore, I do not see many boundaries between economists and econometricians.","title":"Question 2"},{"location":"articles/AMA/TheCurrentandFutureofEconometrics/#question-3","text":"William: Your recent Econometrica paper ( Abadie et al. 2020 ) discusses an alternative way of interpreting standard errors in regressions as design-based uncertainty, in addition to the traditional sample-based uncertainty. Would you like to elaborate more on this paper? What does this result mean to the empirical researchers? When should we interpret standard errors in a design-based way, as suggested in the paper? Figure 3: Sampling-Based versus Design-Based Uncertainty in Regression Analysis Prof. Wooldridge: Thanks for this question. We\u2019re still working together on the paper, and we extend the initial work to the case where one might have to cluster the standard errors to account for either cluster sampling or some clustering in the design itself, the assignment of the treatment and the control groups. Then, we realized that we didn\u2019t actually fully understand the non-clustering case where we were taking random samples. We would think about not necessarily randomly assigning a policy, but where the assignment was independent across the units. This question used to come up to me. Occasionally, students would say, \u201cyou\u2019ve taught us how to analyze ordinary least squares [2], the asymptotic properties from the perspective of taking a random sample from the population, but what happens if you observe the entire population?\u201d, which is a great question because we often do, especially with aggregated data at the county level (e.g. counties, provinces). You see all of them. When you do any kind of econometric method like ordinary least squares (OLS), how do you interpret the standard errors that are reported? We decided to try to bridge this gap. There\u2019s been a long history in the design-based approach. The statisticians were involved many years ago and thought about having the population data. There\u2019s no sampling, but what you do have is that you have potential outcomes in both a control state and a treated state. Then, all the uncertainty comes through assigning units to the control or the treated. Now, the randomness comes from the situation where we only observe each unit in one state of the world. The way we assign the treatment is random. My books focus a lot on the random sampling case, so it seemed natural to try to come up with a framework to bring those two together. The framework provides a smooth transition from the case where you have random sampling from a large population all the way to the case where there\u2019s no sampling, and you observe the entire population. We manage to come up with a formula that covers all those cases. You can see explicitly that the formula for the proper variance depends on the fraction of the population that you observe. Therefore, one of the important insights that comes out of this is that if you observe the whole population and use the usual standard errors, they are conservative , so your confidence intervals are wider than they need to be in general. There are some cases where they\u2019re not conservative, when there is no underlying heterogeneity in the effects across people. There are cases where the usual heteroscedasticity-robust standard error, the so-called Eicker\u2013Huber\u2013White standard errors, are the right ones. But in general, they are conservative. Therefore, at least for now, if you have the whole population, you\u2019re using conservative errors. We actually have something in the paper that hasn\u2019t been applied as much, which is when you do observe the whole population or a significant fraction of the population, there\u2019s a way to adjust your standard errors to make them smaller. It\u2019s making them smaller in a legitimate way, because as you observe more of the population, the sampling error becomes less. Our paper shows exactly how the adjustment works, which is quite simple. Once somebody programs this up in Stata, I hope that it\u2019ll be used quite regularly. Moreover, there\u2019s some simple tricks to use it now based on using formulas from the stratified sampling literature, which also has a history in statistics. All of this research draws on lots of different fields, and it\u2019s becoming very interdisciplinary.","title":"Question 3"},{"location":"articles/AMA/TheCurrentandFutureofEconometrics/#question-4","text":"Prof. Luyao Zhang: In the past years, you have done much work improving our knowledge on some widely used econometric models, including instrument variables, difference-in-difference, and treatment effects ( S\u0142oczy\u0144ski and Wooldridge 2018 ; Wooldridge 2019 ; Wooldridge 2021 ). How do you think these new findings will influence the way empirical researchers apply these models? In which scenarios should we apply these new models? More generally, how do you think empirical researchers should learn about the latest econometric methods? Figure 4: Intuition of difference-in-difference Prof. Wooldridge: Of course, I hope empirical people would use my research regularly. You\u2019ve mentioned a few topics that I\u2019ve been working on, and I do continue to work on those. One of the methods that has become quite useful recently by combining methods from traditional treatment effects [3] with difference-in-difference [4] is the so-called doubly robust estimators that again have a history of statistics. I worked on this more than 15 years ago. I published a paper in 2007 in the Journal of Econometrics ( Wooldridge 2007 ) that proposed a particular kind of doubly robust estimator. If you\u2019re estimating a treatment effect, typically there are two approaches. Maybe more than two, but I will focus on two. You can use regression adjustment, which means you estimate models for the conditional mean of the outcome variable; You can use some propensity score method, which means you estimate a model for the treatment. It has been known for a while that you can combine those two to come up with an estimator which has a doubly robust property. The name is maybe not quite the right one, but it means that you only have to have one of the two models correct in order to consistently estimate the average treatment effect. That was derived in the context of cross-sectional analysis, but it turns out to be noticed by other researchers. And then something I\u2019m working on is that you can apply these robust methods to the panel data case as well, when you have difference-in-difference-type designs in a policy intervention. You have data before and after; you have a control group and a treatment group, and it turns out that you can apply this to even fairly complicated structures with staggered designs. You did mention the difference-in-difference work, so let me focus on what I\u2019ve actually written about. I think this is generally a good lesson that I showed you can use traditional regression methods . In particular, you can expand the usual two-way fixed effects estimator. Actually, it\u2019s not expanding the estimator, but expanding the model. My interpretation of the recent criticism of two-way fixed effects is that it\u2019s not a criticism of the estimator but a criticism of the model. The model assumes a single treatment effect, regardless of how many cohorts there are and how long the time period is for the intervention. And I simply noted that if you set things up properly, you can apply regression methods to estimate a much more flexible model, and this largely overcomes the criticisms of the simple two way fixed effects analysis. So, what I tried to emphasize with my students is that it\u2019s very important to keep separate the notion of a model and an estimation method . And I sometimes forget myself. I will say things like OLS model, but OLS is not a model. It\u2019s an estimation method which we can apply to various kinds of models. It\u2019s up to us to be creative and use the tools that we have so that we apply those methods to models that don\u2019t make strong assumptions. I hope that this idea bridges again a lot of my research, which is pretty simple. It\u2019s trying to find simpler ways to do more flexible analysis, at the point that it gets really hard.","title":"Question 4"},{"location":"articles/AMA/TheCurrentandFutureofEconometrics/#question-5","text":"William: On your Twitter, you criticized that machine learning is \u201crunning simulations until my new estimator looks notably better than existing estimators\u201d. Can you elaborate on your thoughts on how machine learning and other high-dimensional methods can improve in order to contribute to the field of economics and econometrics? Figure 5: Machine Learning Prof. Wooldridge: Posting on Twitter is a bit different than actually writing a serious research paper. But I was, of course, partly making a joke there because I was in the middle of doing some simulations for some recent nonlinear difference-in-differences methods that I\u2019ve been working on. But then I was thinking, as I was doing the simulations and changing the parameters of the simulations, am I doing this to learn about how this estimator compares with other estimators, or am I trying to rig it so that my estimator looks the best? So, I was really just making a statement. Like you know, it\u2019s human nature to want yours to be the best, right? One uses the machine to learn about that, and I\u2019m partly making a statement. I\u2019m trying to be as objective as I can by showing cases where the methods I\u2019m proposing work better but also being upfront about cases where other methods will work better. It\u2019s not completely unrelated to machine learning, though. When we publish papers, the best way to get your work published is to show that it works better than existing methods. Since the people writing the theory and deriving the methods are the same ones doing the simulations, it will probably be better if there\u2019s some disconnection there. We have some ways of objectively evaluating these methods now. If something becomes popular enough, others will evaluate it. But I think simulations are still needed to know about how something works in the real world. I\u2019ve always thought that we should have more competitions, such as blind competitions where people who participate don\u2019t know what the truth is. They apply their favorite method across a bunch of different scenarios, so we can evaluate how the different methods do. I\u2019m guessing that machine learning will come out pretty well with that, but that\u2019s an impression. I\u2019m not convinced that somebody using basic methods who has good intuition and is creative can\u2019t do as well. This does raise the issue of machine learning and its future. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve seen in your data analysis, where this has to have come up a fair amount. I think the work on applying machine learning methods to causal inference has guaranteed that it will have a long history in econometrics and other fields that use data analysis. When I took visits to campuses, Amazon, Google, they\u2019re using machine learning methods quite a bit. That\u2019s no secret. These companies are in the business of earning profits, and they\u2019re not going to employ methods that somehow aren\u2019t working for them. So, I think the market is certainly speaking on that. For prediction purposes, they seem to work very well.","title":"Question 5"},{"location":"articles/AMA/TheCurrentandFutureofEconometrics/#reflections","text":"Prof. Luyao Zhang: Yes, sounds very interesting! Prof. Wooldridge points out promising directions for machine learning from just a prediction to find more scientific results. You can have machine learning plus causal inference. Zichao and Yufan are both from the data science major, so it will be great to hear their comments, especially those about the econometrics and machine learning. Yufan Zhang: Prof. Wooldridge\u2019s point about machine learning resonates with me as a data science student. The more I study some advanced machine learning models, especially deep learning models, the more I feel that it\u2019s unscientific. Many newly proposed models today are very functional and well-performed but also very complicated. Most of what the researchers are doing is just to try different models, such as adding different modules to the model. If the result of one structure doesn\u2019t work, they just try another one. So I think that\u2019s indeed the problem that the whole machine learning is, especially deep learning, is facing now. Prof. Jeffrey Wooldridge: It is a very good observation. Since I\u2019ve only dabbled in machine learning a bit, I don\u2019t have the experience that you have on how people are using it and progressing. Probably at the end, it\u2019s just like other econometric methods where people try a lot of different things, and they only report the one that gives the result that they want. So, perhaps machine learning hasn\u2019t saved us from that as much as we\u2019re being led to believe it. There is a bait. Just to follow up on that, I\u2019ve seen plenty of papers that jump right into the very difficult thing, which misses the low hanging fruit. In other words, there are simple ways to do things like causal inference. For example, one can estimate causal effects with instrumental variables to exploit the structure in ways that haven\u2019t been exploited before, instead of going fully to machine learning, the black box.

About Professor Olivier Marin: Figure 1: Professor Olivier Marin Mr. Olivier Marin is a Professor of Practice in Computer Science at NYU Shanghai. Marin received his Ph.D. in Computer Science in 2003 from the Universite du Havre, France. Marin is an expert in Operating Systems. His current research focuses on distributed middleware [1] solutions for dependability in various environments: delay-tolerant networks [2], clouds [3], and P2P networks [4]. And his research interests include fault tolerance [5], recommendation systems [6], multi-agent systems [7], and distributed architectures [8]for the management of Big Data. Module 1 1. What is your motivation for doing fintech/blockchain research? Prof. Marin: I\u2019m not interested so much in fintech, but very much so in blockchain technology for very simple reasons. I\u2019ve been working since my Ph.D. on what we call fault tolerance in distributed systems. Distributed systems are any type of computer system that you use, where not only one machine is involved, but several machines. When we are discussing a blockchain infrastructure, which is not just the machine in front of you, it also includes other computers playing different roles. Some of them are miners, some of them hold the ledgers, some of them validate or do stuff like that. Inherently, a blockchain is such a distributed system. I said I\u2019m interested in fault tolerance in distributed systems. So what is fault tolerance? Fault tolerance happens when you have several computers \u2014 for sure, the more computers you have involved, the higher the likelihood that one of them is going to do something wrong. It doesn\u2019t need to be malicious. It can be that the computer just dies, it happens. Maybe someone cuts the power, or it simply breaks. So, my work in research from the start was: how I can guarantee with all of these machines working together, that if one of them or several of them die at the same time, how can I make sure that the rest of the system can still survive this. Figure 2: Consensus mechanism There is a specific theoretical area in my domain that is called consensus [2]. I\u2019m pretty sure that if you\u2019ve read any material on blockchain and fintech, you\u2019ve come across that word. Consensus is a specific theoretical construct that allows several participants to agree on something they want to reach a common value decision. Now we\u2019ve had theoretical papers answering the question of how you can reach a consensus after decades of development in computer science research. In particular, the research question is: Is consensus reachable? We even have theoretical proofs that, in many situations, a consensus is not reachable. That\u2019s where I\u2019m particularly interested in blockchains because they are used as technological support for financial applications. But as a fact, fintech\u2019s claim about its 100 % reliability is not true, as proven in the theoretical papers. It cannot be true. Because underneath the theoretical mathematics of it, all say that there are moments where I could destroy the blockchains. If I can have all of the computers, I can switch off the power to all of these computers. It\u2019s over! You don\u2019t have your blockchain. Luckily enough, the idea of a blockchain is that the probability that all of your computers die together is very low. So, what I\u2019m interested in is, what are the boundaries? What is it that makes it so that the blockchain can survive? What kinds of failures, to what degree does this survival work? But one thing is sure: Normally, if at least half of the machines are malicious, you cannot have a consensus, or at least you cannot have an honest consensus. The initial Bitcoin paper already talks about the 51 % attack. The fact that if one entity controls more than half of the network, it\u2019s over. There\u2019s no way you can build anything that you can trust. Now, we\u2019ve moved this towards a different setting with plenty of different machines, but no one specifically owns all of the machines. I\u2019m also interested that when you have one entity that controls everything, what should you do to guarantee that you\u2019re still going to trust the results? So what\u2019s my motivation for doing research about blockchain? Because blockchains are built on top of my area of interest. 2. If you have 100 computers and maybe several of them break down anyway. I wonder how you can tell which ones are broken and which are not. For instance, 80 % of the computers give the same result, and the rest remaining 20 % give a different result. Although the probability is very low, I think it\u2019s also possible that 80 % of computers\u2019 results are wrong, right? Figure 3: Consensus mechanism in blockchain Prof. Marin: It\u2019s a great question. We have a foundational paper in my domain called FLP 85 . It was written by Fischer, Lynch, and Paterson in 1985 (\u201c Impossibility of Distributed Consensus with One Faulty Process \u201d), hence FLP 85. The paper talks about the impossibility of consensus, even between two machines when the system is asynchronous. Asynchronous means that there is no time-bound between the sending and the reception of a message if I want to put it really simply. It\u2019s a bit more complicated, but that\u2019s the gist of it. Give you an example. Let\u2019s say that you\u2019re talking to me regularly. And, suddenly, you stop speaking for 20 seconds. You just sat there, looking at me. I\u2019m going to start getting worried, right? I\u2019m going to call you by your name, say, hello, are you there? You might keep on not answering me. How do I know? How do I make the difference between you\u2019re playing a joke on me, you just pretending not to be able to talk to me, and you being dead? The answer is, I can\u2019t make the difference. If I walk over to you and I listen to your heartbeats, and then I can say you\u2019re alive. But when we are two separate machines, the machine can\u2019t walk over and listen to the heartbeats. The result of this paper says it\u2019s a network where I don\u2019t have a bound on the time that it takes to send a message. If someone stops talking to me, I can never decide whether they\u2019re malicious or whether they\u2019re just slow. What does that mean? It means that in order to make a decision, I need to wait until they talk to me again until I get communication that shows me that they\u2019re alive. However, maybe the consequence is that I have to wait an infinite time to hear from you and make a decision. That means I cannot potentially make a decision. Therefore, coming back to your 20% vs. 80% question, the answer is there\u2019s no way we can answer. In a real-life situation, messages get lost, computers break. Sometimes messages get routed a long way, and they will come, and you just have to wait. If that were true, we would have no internet! So lucky fair enough: we cheat. What we do is we put a boundary arbitrary time limit. After, let\u2019s say, 10 seconds (if I still don\u2019t receive messages from a machine), I\u2019m going to decide it\u2019s not talking to me, fair enough. I might be making the wrong decision. Because maybe, at the 11th second, it\u2019s going to send me the message. Figure 4: 51% attacks in the blockchain Now, I\u2019m in a situation where I have 10 machines, 8 of them will answer me and 2 of them will not. That\u2019s kind of fine because if I wanted to make a decision, I only care if at least half of them talk to me. If I get 5 answers, I know that I have a majority of machines. If they\u2019re all the same and they all agree with me, that makes 6 out of 11. Whatever the others might say, they\u2019re going to be wrong because they are the minority. If I say that more than half of the nodes can be malicious, if I have a vote of 6 machines, including me, we might all be the malicious machines. And this is the 51 % attack when we are malicious and are controlling the system. So, back to how you formulated your question, basically, you laid out what happens when we try to build a consensus: we have to accept that some machines might not answer. And we have to accept that every time the decision we reach is not fair proof. That\u2019s why I can say that for those fintech solutions, theoretically, they cannot claim to be 100% reliable. It\u2019s a system about trust. Module 2 3. Can you briefly highlight your research in the field of fintech/blockchain? Prof. Marin: #1 Project: A decentralized system with a \u201creputation\u201d rating I have three interesting projects. The first one, I\u2019ve already published a bit on that topic, but not specifically with blockchain. It\u2019s in the Oxford Computer Journal of Oxford (\u201c ASCENT: A Provably Terminating Decentralized Logging Service \u201d). We wanted a system that would maintain a ledger that is completely distributed, with no centralized server, no entity that\u2019s in the middle, and that decides everything. We share everything with plenty of machines. We want to make sure that when a transaction is being done with two machines trying to make a transaction, we keep track of that transaction, and none of the machines can go back to deny what they have pledged. And afterward, we can actually show that all of these have been recorded by a majority of machines, so we never lose this. Now you might think it\u2019s blockchain. But we didn\u2019t do it in a blockchain. We made another type of system, a peer-to-peer system. So we have the first part: building a ledger. And the point was that a blockchain relies on the proof-of-work, proof-of-stake, or many other ways to do it. But anyways, that works when everyone has a vested interest in upholding the system because they\u2019ve put money or put work or labor into creating the values. But the thing is, it works until a given point because of what we just discussed in the previous question. What happens when I have a majority of liars? The system I worked on for that paper was not built with all of the machines being equal because the problem with this majority attack is the machines are equally performing. If I have proof-of-work, the miners will all have an equal chance of finding the numbers and of gaining that. However, there is another type of distributed system called reputation system. This is another area that I am interested in. Reputation systems are what we have in Taobao: when you buy from someone, you look at the rating. We look at the number of hearts, diamonds, or crowns. You may not be worrying about the good quality if the vendor has golden crowns. This is not entirely distributed because it has Taobao that centralizes the rating of the vendors. However, the cool thing is you have plenty of transactions all the time. What we built was as you have transactions inside the distributed system, you\u2019re going to rate the other machines. And the ratings are going to tell you, is that a machine I can trust? If it\u2019s a machine I can trust, I will give it more possibilities of having more transactions. Hence, the system is built more on trustworthy machines rather than on all machines. But then we have a different type of problem. We\u2019ve solved the 51% problem, but now you can still subvert the system if you gain enough of a reputation. So we need a way to assess the reputations in a scheme that someone cannot cheat with. So in that particular paper, we use reputations to build blockchains with the ledger only with the machines you think are trustworthy. That is the first area. #2 Project: Quick payments verified by witnesses on the blockchain Figure 5: Witnesses and proofs on the blockchain The second area is still in development, and I have discussed this with Yulin. This idea came to me because I was trying to pay with Alipay in a supermarket once, and I didn\u2019t have any network connectivity. I didn\u2019t have any cash either. The cashier was nice enough that he allowed me to go elsewhere, caught a QR code, and ran back quickly to pay. This story shows that, unfortunately, even with centralized payments, sometimes you can\u2019t connect and pay. Let\u2019s go back to the blockchain. There are now actually 2 Bitcoin systems. One is Bitcoin, and the other is BitCash. The Bitcoin system is not made for that kind of transaction because it accepts validated transactions over a longer period to be trustworthy. But BitCash is exactly for that kind of payment. BitCash built a parallel system on the blockchain, where the number of transactions is much bigger. So it means a bigger throughput, and so blocks get mined much faster, and you don\u2019t have to wait for an hour long. Although you may have quick payments, it doesn\u2019t alleviate the fact that if it goes faster, you can still cheat because there\u2019s a point where sometimes the network is not accessible. When the vendor cannot certify that you can pay, there are two ways they might say. For one, they\u2019re going to say you can\u2019t pay. For the other, they\u2019re going to trust you for a given amount of time. Especially in China, if you cheated, the police are going to catch you. In general, that\u2019s how it works. In other countries, it might not work that way. So as I said before, we\u2019re trying to work on the boundaries, we\u2019re trying to see what are the minimum requirements to allow for a direct payment system on your phone that would use the blockchain, but only once you connect back. So when you pay someone, if you don\u2019t have access to the internet, the vendor and other buyers keep track of what they\u2019ve done the event. And when they go back to connectivity, they will send this and notify the ledger and confirm that this happened. However, there may be a problem here: it\u2019s one word of someone against the word of the other. However, we could reinforce this. We could have witnesses when I am out of connectivity from 5G or Wifi, and maybe I still have other people who have phones nearby. When I have the transaction, I could send a token saying, look, the transaction took place. If I have enough people as witnesses, they can walk away and then verify this transaction. It is like a tiny reputation system on a local scale for the purpose of quick payments. So, this is the second project I\u2019m working on. #3 Project: Innovative education on blockchain-an integration of CS & ECON Figure 6: Blockchain innovation education In the third project, we are working with Professor. Elaf ElliotIlaf Elard to build a course on blockchain technology. It\u2019ll be a mix of economics students and CS students. I\u2019m not an expert in economics or finance. I honestly don\u2019t understand why anyone would want to use a cryptocurrency based on the blockchain. Specifically, for the reasons I gave you, I do not trust consensus because I know what consensus is. So I would never put my money there, ever! But still, you can see that the rates fluctuate a lot for several reasons. Elon Musk comes around and suddenly breaks the system. But people do invest, and there is actually value created. I cannot understand why this happens. But what the economics students could gain is an understanding of the underlying technology so that when they make financial or economic decisions, they understand why. Because blockchains right now, in my opinion, are a buzzword. If you go to any fintech company, they use \u201cblockchain\u201d, even when they just have four machines, they say blockchain. Because then investors are going to give them cash. So, I really want students to be aware of the technology and the economy behind it, so that they can make informed decisions. The research itself is how we can create pedagogical tools that describe all of those complicated notions, such as consensus, double-spending [10], public key, etc. Can we reduce them to something easy to understand for students who don\u2019t want to major in computer science but still want to understand the general idea behind it? There are two tracks we\u2019re working on. One is about how double-spending works. The second one is about how blocks are minded and how they are chained next to each other, including why it works, why you have a ledger, and how it is built. Module 3 4. How do you think the Internet Computer can possibly empower your research? What support do you need to innovate with the Internet Computer? What technique questions do you have for the DFINITY engineers? Figure 7: Difinity and Internet computers Prof. Marin: The research I\u2019m interested in is built on a theoretical prototype. I usually try to show that it works with my experiment. I evaluate the performance, and I look at whether my idea was worth it or not. So, the cool thing is, I don\u2019t compete with theoretical researchers. I am in an area that I think is important for computer science, because we are not just a science. We also have an engineering portion where you write software, and you check whether it works or not. Hence, the Internet Computer can empower my research as an experimental power, as a platform to test my ideas. Suppose I could use the blockchain that is on the DFINITY and see if I can connect it with non-connected devices, even if I simulate them and see how I can cheat with those, whether I can use what we call a man-in-the-middle attack (MITM Attack) [11], what happens between the point where I have the transaction and the moment where I insert it in the Internet Computer. So basically, I need concrete software and hardware capability that allows me to run my experiments and show whether they work or not. Even things that don\u2019t work are also super interesting in my area. Because when they don\u2019t work, you can show why. So that\u2019s the answer to the first question. They can empower my research simply as they give me the capacity to come and use the machines. Prof. Marin: The second part is, what support do I need? First of all, access to the platform. I\u2019d like to access the hardware and software. Second, fundings or people who can collaborate on my research projects are welcomed. What I also need is to propagate and discuss ideas. We are a small institution for now in Shanghai. Experimental research, unfortunately, needs manpower. In my particular area of research, here, I\u2019m the only one. So I\u2019m working alone and doing experimental research alone. I can work with undergrads right now, but undergrads may not yet have all the knowledge and skill to be able to ask very tough questions because they\u2019re on the verge of knowing how to do that. So, if I could get help with either funding or people coming to work on this particular aspect of research, that would be great. I would also like to organize some workshops, bringing colleagues from my domain to discuss these aspects and to prepare the prototypes. Prof. Marin: Then, the technical questions that I have for DFINITY engineers. I co-supervised a capstone project with Prof. Luyao Zhang and Prof. Yulin Liu. The topic is to implement a stablecoin on top of the Internet Computer. The result was disappointing. Maybe that\u2019s because of the unstable versions of the software that we are running initially at the time of the capstone project. As you probably know, the Internet Computer is publicly open very recently. So it is great to have access to that, probably if we were doing the same thing now, maybe it would work better. And I don\u2019t really have other exact technical questions now for the definitive engineers. The main questions would be the following. First, what parts are actually completely stable now? Is there a clear API [5] of the Internet Computer and stable calls (the functions that we can call inside) and see exactly what they do and how they work? Second, do we have all the technical specifications of the hardware that is underneath and of the software that is running the blockchain? If we had all this, then that would help a lot. Conclusion Supports that Prof. Marin may need from DFINITY: First of all, access to the platform. I\u2019d like to access the hardware and software. Second, fundings or people who can collaborate on my research projects are welcomed. What I also need is to propagate and discuss ideas. Prof. Marin\u2019s questions for DFINITY engineers/developers: What parts of the Internet Computer are actually completely stable now? Is there a clear API of the Internet Computer? Are there stable calls (the functions that we can call inside) and can we see exactly what they do and how they work? Do we have all the technical specifications of the hardware that is underneath and of the software that is running the blockchain? If we had all this, then that would help a lot.

What is your motivation for doing fintech/blockchain research? Prof. Marin: I\u2019m not interested so much in fintech, but very much so in blockchain technology for very simple reasons. I\u2019ve been working since my Ph.D. on what we call fault tolerance in distributed systems. Distributed systems are any type of computer system that you use, where not only one machine is involved, but several machines. When we are discussing a blockchain infrastructure, which is not just the machine in front of you, it also includes other computers playing different roles. Some of them are miners, some of them hold the ledgers, some of them validate or do stuff like that. Inherently, a blockchain is such a distributed system. I said I\u2019m interested in fault tolerance in distributed systems. So what is fault tolerance? Fault tolerance happens when you have several computers \u2014 for sure, the more computers you have involved, the higher the likelihood that one of them is going to do something wrong. It doesn\u2019t need to be malicious. It can be that the computer just dies, it happens. Maybe someone cuts the power, or it simply breaks. So, my work in research from the start was: how I can guarantee with all of these machines working together, that if one of them or several of them die at the same time, how can I make sure that the rest of the system can still survive this. Figure 2: Consensus mechanism There is a specific theoretical area in my domain that is called consensus [2]. I\u2019m pretty sure that if you\u2019ve read any material on blockchain and fintech, you\u2019ve come across that word. Consensus is a specific theoretical construct that allows several participants to agree on something they want to reach a common value decision. Now we\u2019ve had theoretical papers answering the question of how you can reach a consensus after decades of development in computer science research. In particular, the research question is: Is consensus reachable? We even have theoretical proofs that, in many situations, a consensus is not reachable. That\u2019s where I\u2019m particularly interested in blockchains because they are used as technological support for financial applications. But as a fact, fintech\u2019s claim about its 100 % reliability is not true, as proven in the theoretical papers. It cannot be true. Because underneath the theoretical mathematics of it, all say that there are moments where I could destroy the blockchains. If I can have all of the computers, I can switch off the power to all of these computers. It\u2019s over! You don\u2019t have your blockchain. Luckily enough, the idea of a blockchain is that the probability that all of your computers die together is very low. So, what I\u2019m interested in is, what are the boundaries? What is it that makes it so that the blockchain can survive? What kinds of failures, to what degree does this survival work? But one thing is sure: Normally, if at least half of the machines are malicious, you cannot have a consensus, or at least you cannot have an honest consensus. The initial Bitcoin paper already talks about the 51 % attack. The fact that if one entity controls more than half of the network, it\u2019s over. There\u2019s no way you can build anything that you can trust. Now, we\u2019ve moved this towards a different setting with plenty of different machines, but no one specifically owns all of the machines. I\u2019m also interested that when you have one entity that controls everything, what should you do to guarantee that you\u2019re still going to trust the results? So what\u2019s my motivation for doing research about blockchain? Because blockchains are built on top of my area of interest. 2. If you have 100 computers and maybe several of them break down anyway. I wonder how you can tell which ones are broken and which are not. For instance, 80 % of the computers give the same result, and the rest remaining 20 % give a different result. Although the probability is very low, I think it\u2019s also possible that 80 % of computers\u2019 results are wrong, right? Figure 3: Consensus mechanism in blockchain Prof. Marin: It\u2019s a great question. We have a foundational paper in my domain called FLP 85 . It was written by Fischer, Lynch, and Paterson in 1985 (\u201c Impossibility of Distributed Consensus with One Faulty Process \u201d), hence FLP 85. The paper talks about the impossibility of consensus, even between two machines when the system is asynchronous. Asynchronous means that there is no time-bound between the sending and the reception of a message if I want to put it really simply. It\u2019s a bit more complicated, but that\u2019s the gist of it. Give you an example. Let\u2019s say that you\u2019re talking to me regularly. And, suddenly, you stop speaking for 20 seconds. You just sat there, looking at me. I\u2019m going to start getting worried, right? I\u2019m going to call you by your name, say, hello, are you there? You might keep on not answering me. How do I know? How do I make the difference between you\u2019re playing a joke on me, you just pretending not to be able to talk to me, and you being dead? The answer is, I can\u2019t make the difference. If I walk over to you and I listen to your heartbeats, and then I can say you\u2019re alive. But when we are two separate machines, the machine can\u2019t walk over and listen to the heartbeats. The result of this paper says it\u2019s a network where I don\u2019t have a bound on the time that it takes to send a message. If someone stops talking to me, I can never decide whether they\u2019re malicious or whether they\u2019re just slow. What does that mean? It means that in order to make a decision, I need to wait until they talk to me again until I get communication that shows me that they\u2019re alive. However, maybe the consequence is that I have to wait an infinite time to hear from you and make a decision. That means I cannot potentially make a decision. Therefore, coming back to your 20% vs. 80% question, the answer is there\u2019s no way we can answer. In a real-life situation, messages get lost, computers break. Sometimes messages get routed a long way, and they will come, and you just have to wait. If that were true, we would have no internet! So lucky fair enough: we cheat. What we do is we put a boundary arbitrary time limit. After, let\u2019s say, 10 seconds (if I still don\u2019t receive messages from a machine), I\u2019m going to decide it\u2019s not talking to me, fair enough. I might be making the wrong decision. Because maybe, at the 11th second, it\u2019s going to send me the message. Figure 4: 51% attacks in the blockchain Now, I\u2019m in a situation where I have 10 machines, 8 of them will answer me and 2 of them will not. That\u2019s kind of fine because if I wanted to make a decision, I only care if at least half of them talk to me. If I get 5 answers, I know that I have a majority of machines. If they\u2019re all the same and they all agree with me, that makes 6 out of 11. Whatever the others might say, they\u2019re going to be wrong because they are the minority. If I say that more than half of the nodes can be malicious, if I have a vote of 6 machines, including me, we might all be the malicious machines. And this is the 51 % attack when we are malicious and are controlling the system. So, back to how you formulated your question, basically, you laid out what happens when we try to build a consensus: we have to accept that some machines might not answer. And we have to accept that every time the decision we reach is not fair proof. That\u2019s why I can say that for those fintech solutions, theoretically, they cannot claim to be 100% reliable. It\u2019s a system about trust.","title":"Module 1"},{"location":"articles/AMA/TheFutureofConsensus%3AAlgorithmonBlockchain/#module-2","text":"3. Can you briefly highlight your research in the field of fintech/blockchain? Prof. Marin: #1 Project: A decentralized system with a \u201creputation\u201d rating I have three interesting projects. The first one, I\u2019ve already published a bit on that topic, but not specifically with blockchain. It\u2019s in the Oxford Computer Journal of Oxford (\u201c ASCENT: A Provably Terminating Decentralized Logging Service \u201d).

You may not be worrying about the good quality if the vendor has golden crowns. This is not entirely distributed because it has Taobao that centralizes the rating of the vendors.

Hence, the system is built more on trustworthy machines rather than on all machines. But then we have a different type of problem. We\u2019ve solved the 51% problem, but now you can still subvert the system if you gain enough of a reputation. So we need a way to assess the reputations in a scheme that someone cannot cheat with. So in that particular paper, we use reputations to build blockchains with the ledger only with the machines you think are trustworthy. That is the first area. #2 Project: Quick payments verified by witnesses on the blockchain Figure 5: Witnesses and proofs on the blockchain The second area is still in development, and I have discussed this with Yulin. This idea came to me because I was trying to pay with Alipay in a supermarket once, and I didn\u2019t have any network connectivity. I didn\u2019t have any cash either. The cashier was nice enough that he allowed me to go elsewhere, caught a QR code, and ran back quickly to pay.

One is Bitcoin, and the other is BitCash. The Bitcoin system is not made for that kind of transaction because it accepts validated transactions over a longer period to be trustworthy. But BitCash is exactly for that kind of payment. BitCash built a parallel system on the blockchain, where the number of transactions is much bigger. So it means a bigger throughput, and so blocks get mined much faster, and you don\u2019t have to wait for an hour long. Although you may have quick payments, it doesn\u2019t alleviate the fact that if it goes faster, you can still cheat because there\u2019s a point where sometimes the network is not accessible. When the vendor cannot certify that you can pay, there are two ways they might say. For one, they\u2019re going to say you can\u2019t pay. For the other, they\u2019re going to trust you for a given amount of time. Especially in China, if you cheated, the police are going to catch you. In general, that\u2019s how it works. In other countries, it might not work that way. So as I said before, we\u2019re trying to work on the boundaries, we\u2019re trying to see what are the minimum requirements to allow for a direct payment system on your phone that would use the blockchain, but only once you connect back. So when you pay someone, if you don\u2019t have access to the internet, the vendor and other buyers keep track of what they\u2019ve done the event. And when they go back to connectivity, they will send this and notify the ledger and confirm that this happened. However, there may be a problem here: it\u2019s one word of someone against the word of the other. However, we could reinforce this. We could have witnesses when I am out of connectivity from 5G or Wifi, and maybe I still have other people who have phones nearby. When I have the transaction, I could send a token saying, look, the transaction took place. If I have enough people as witnesses, they can walk away and then verify this transaction. It is like a tiny reputation system on a local scale for the purpose of quick payments. So, this is the second project I\u2019m working on. #3 Project: Innovative education on blockchain-an integration of CS & ECON Figure 6: Blockchain innovation education In the third project, we are working with Professor. Elaf ElliotIlaf Elard to build a course on blockchain technology. It\u2019ll be a mix of economics students and CS students. I\u2019m not an expert in economics or finance. I honestly don\u2019t understand why anyone would want to use a cryptocurrency based on the blockchain. Specifically, for the reasons I gave you, I do not trust consensus because I know what consensus is. So I would never put my money there, ever! But still, you can see that the rates fluctuate a lot for several reasons. Elon Musk comes around and suddenly breaks the system. But people do invest, and there is actually value created. I cannot understand why this happens. But what the economics students could gain is an understanding of the underlying technology so that when they make financial or economic decisions, they understand why. Because blockchains right now, in my opinion, are a buzzword. If you go to any fintech company, they use \u201cblockchain\u201d, even when they just have four machines, they say blockchain. Because then investors are going to give them cash. So, I really want students to be aware of the technology and the economy behind it, so that they can make informed decisions. The research itself is how we can create pedagogical tools that describe all of those complicated notions, such as consensus, double-spending [10], public key, etc. Can we reduce them to something easy to understand for students who don\u2019t want to major in computer science but still want to understand the general idea behind it? There are two tracks we\u2019re working on. One is about how double-spending works. The second one is about how blocks are minded and how they are chained next to each other, including why it works, why you have a ledger, and how it is built.","title":"Module 2"},{"location":"articles/AMA/TheFutureofConsensus%3AAlgorithmonBlockchain/#module-3","text":"4. How do you think the Internet Computer can possibly empower your research? What support do you need to innovate with the Internet Computer? What technique questions do you have for the DFINITY engineers? Figure 7: Difinity and Internet computers Prof. Marin: The research I\u2019m interested in is built on a theoretical prototype. I usually try to show that it works with my experiment. I evaluate the performance, and I look at whether my idea was worth it or not. So, the cool thing is, I don\u2019t compete with theoretical researchers. I am in an area that I think is important for computer science, because we are not just a science. We also have an engineering portion where you write software, and you check whether it works or not. Hence, the Internet Computer can empower my research as an experimental power, as a platform to test my ideas. Suppose I could use the blockchain that is on the DFINITY and see if I can connect it with non-connected devices, even if I simulate them and see how I can cheat with those, whether I can use what we call a man-in-the-middle attack (MITM Attack) [11], what happens between the point where I have the transaction and the moment where I insert it in the Internet Computer. So basically, I need concrete software and hardware capability that allows me to run my experiments and show whether they work or not. Even things that don\u2019t work are also super interesting in my area. Because when they don\u2019t work, you can show why. So that\u2019s the answer to the first question. They can empower my research simply as they give me the capacity to come and use the machines. Prof. Marin: The second part is, what support do I need? First of all, access to the platform. I\u2019d like to access the hardware and software. Second, fundings or people who can collaborate on my research projects are welcomed. What I also need is to propagate and discuss ideas. We are a small institution for now in Shanghai. Experimental research, unfortunately, needs manpower. In my particular area of research, here, I\u2019m the only one. So I\u2019m working alone and doing experimental research alone. I can work with undergrads right now, but undergrads may not yet have all the knowledge and skill to be able to ask very tough questions because they\u2019re on the verge of knowing how to do that. So, if I could get help with either funding or people coming to work on this particular aspect of research, that would be great. I would also like to organize some workshops, bringing colleagues from my domain to discuss these aspects and to prepare the prototypes. Prof. Marin: Then, the technical questions that I have for DFINITY engineers. I co-supervised a capstone project with Prof. Luyao Zhang and Prof. Yulin Liu. The topic is to implement a stablecoin on top of the Internet Computer. The result was disappointing. Maybe that\u2019s because of the unstable versions of the software that we are running initially at the time of the capstone project. As you probably know, the Internet Computer is publicly open very recently. So it is great to have access to that, probably if we were doing the same thing now, maybe it would work better. And I don\u2019t really have other exact technical questions now for the definitive engineers. The main questions would be the following. First, what parts are actually completely stable now? Is there a clear API [5] of the Internet Computer and stable calls (the functions that we can call inside) and see exactly what they do and how they work? Second, do we have all the technical specifications of the hardware that is underneath and of the software that is running the blockchain? If we had all this, then that would help a lot.","title":"Module 3"},{"location":"articles/AMA/TheFutureofConsensus%3AAlgorithmonBlockchain/#conclusion","text":"Supports that Prof. Marin may need from DFINITY: First of all, access to the platform.

Middleware supports and simplifies complex distributed applications. [Wikipedia] [2]Delay-tolerant Networks\uff1a Delay-tolerant networking (DTN) is an approach to computer network architecture that seeks to address the technical issues in heterogeneous networks that may lack continuous network connectivity. Examples of such networks are those operating in mobile or extreme terrestrial environments, or planned networks in space. [Wikipedia] [3]Clouds Cloud computing is the on-demand availability of computer system resources, especially data storage (cloud storage) and computing power, without direct active management by the user. The term is generally used to describe data centers available to many users over the Internet. [Wikipedia] [4]P2P Networks Peer-to-peer (P2P) computing or networking is a distributed application architecture that partitions tasks or workloads between peers. Peers are equally privileged, equipotent participants in the application. They are said to form a peer-to-peer network of nodes. [Wikipedia] [5]Fault Tolerance: What is Fault Tolerance? Fault tolerance refers to the ability of a system (computer, network, cloud cluster, etc.) to continue operating without interruption when one or more of its components fail. The objective of creating a fault-tolerant system is to prevent disruptions arising from a single point of failure, ensuring the high availability and business continuity of mission-critical applications or systems. [Wikipedia] [Imperva] [6]Recommendation system A recommendation system is a subclass of information filtering systems that seeks to predict the \u201crating\u201d or \u201cpreference\u201d a user would give to an item. Recommender systems are used in a variety of areas, with commonly recognized examples taking the form of playlist generators for video and music services, product recommenders for online stores, or content recommenders for social media platforms and open web content recommenders. [Wikipedia] [7]Multi-agent system A multi-agent system is a computerized system composed of multiple interacting intelligent agents. Multi-agent systems can solve problems that are difficult or impossible for an individual agent or a monolithic system to solve. [Wikipedia] [8]Distributed architecture In a distributed architecture, components are presented on different platforms and several components can cooperate with one another over a communication network in order to achieve a specific objective or goal. [TutorialsPoint] [9] Consensus: What is Consensus? A consensus mechanism is a fault-tolerant mechanism that is used in computer and blockchain systems to achieve the necessary agreement on a single data value or a single state of the network among distributed processes or multi-agent systems, such as with cryptocurrencies. It is useful in record-keeping, among other things. Some examples of consensus? proof of work (POW), proof of stake (POS) [Investopedia] [Wikipedia] [10] Double-spending: What is Double-spending? Double-spending is the risk that a digital currency can be spent twice. Unlike physical cash, a digital token consists of a digital file that can be duplicated or falsified. How does Bitcoin solve double spending? Bitcoin was the first major digital currency to solve the issue of double-spending. Information from blocks is added to the ledger every few minutes; all nodes on the network maintain a copy of the blockchain ledger. [Investopedia1] [Investopedia2] [Wikipedia] [11] : Man-in-the-middle attack (MITM Attack) What is an MITM attack? A MITM attack is a cyberattack where the attacker secretly relays and possibly alters the communications between two parties who believe that they are directly communicating with each other. One example of a MITM attack is active eavesdropping , in which the attacker makes independent connections with the victims and relays messages between them to make them believe they are talking directly to each other over a private connection, when in fact the entire conversation is controlled by the attacker. [Wikipedia] [Imperva] [CSO] [12] : API What does Prof. Marin say about API? \u201cAn API is what we call an application programming interface. It\u2019s what a computer scientist or developer uses to be able with a program to use services on another program.\u201d What are some simple examples of API?

Figure 3: 50+ Blockchain Real World Uses Cases Mr. Du: Instead of fintech, I\u2019m more interested in the broader application of blockchain. I will say that I\u2019m not particularly interested in fintech as a sector. I\u2019m looking more broadly in terms of the content architecture because personally, I think the advent of cryptocurrency, especially in the form of bitcoin and associated, non-fiat currency [1], is the wrong clique, the wrong approach towards actual financialization of blockchain. The only piece that is really useful that comes out of this will be blockchain. And the key to understanding blockchain is not, I think, to have a fintech-focused application, but in terms of the broader context. How do you take this framework of verifiable transactions and apply it more broadly towards different domains? Blockchain will become a more applicable and profitable mechanism when applied to the content collaboration domain. So blockchain, if you see it as a verifiable transaction system, is a lot more useful if you apply it to the content domain, where the content update is built on transactions. So you actually go away from this draft, publish, expire model of content publishing and go towards a collaborative, dynamic model built around transactions. So actual owners can shape their own narratives, conduct contribution transactions with contributors, thereby build consensus for actionable plans or comprehensive analysis, and that makes blockchain a much more widely applicable and profitable mechanism. Can you briefly highlight your research in the field of fintech/blockchain? Figure 4: How does a transaction get into the blockchain? Mr. Du: My research emphasizes low overhead high efficiency In terms of my personal research into blockchain, I have to say that I keep up with the latest publications, but my emphasis is on low overhead high efficiency transactions. How do you make blockchain transactions efficient to a degree the computational expense is justified? And for me, I think the threshold has already been reached, especially when considering my conceptual applications, which is where you take an integrated blockchain system and go to an enterprise, and say hey, you know, currently your enterprise is generating this much content, like your contract and your proposals. And in general, we can expect how many interactions happen on each particular output document, and what is the overhead for making interactions into verifiable transactions. Then we measure the latency for each of these interactions and make sure that it meets business requirements, tune configuration if needed, and you\u2019re done. As a mediator, I facilitate collaborations between individual installations And then, as a mediator, between installations, in terms of the internet computer concept, it\u2019s the canister. To me, each installation would be a canister, right? You have your own system, including blockchain verification. And what I would have to do is try to collaborate between canisters, between installations. I just have to say, query your blockchain engine and say, hey, can you verify this person\u2019s contribution history is legit. You make sure everything is verified, and then you calculate the collaborative rank of that person that is trying to collaborate with this other person. If it meets a threshold, then they\u2019ll say, it\u2019s a yes, then let\u2019s go. So everything is encapsulated within that individual installation. How do you think the Internet Computer can possibly empower your research? What support do you need to innovate with the Internet Computer? What technique questions do you have for the DFINITY engineers? Figure 5: DIFINITY and Internet Computer Mr. Du: So one video that I saw on YouTube, which was how the consensus mechanism [2] works for different installations, allows for screening out malicious factors I guess. I will be interested in seeing how much of that they are anticipating, and the level of redundancy? Because what I would imagine in my particular application scenario, is that the source of the data, for any enterprise, has to be that installation. Because what I want to see is ownership of content by the participants. So instead of this google, Facebook model, where it is like, you create something and they own it. What you have to do is, there is trust, trust in the participants, and respect the rights of participants. You create something, and you own it, not anybody else. So how does the consensus mechanism [2] fit into that structure? Because to my mind, there is a point of authority, and that authority has to lie within the organization. But, maybe we use some kind of external replication of the blockchain (not the content) for verification, so you can make sure as an outside entity that the organization that source the data does not falsify the data, does not go in and change stuff and hack around and screw up with the historical record. So maybe that\u2019s an application of the consensus mechanism? But how that works in terms of the actual deployment structure wasn\u2019t very clear. Would it be configurable? Optional configuration options? Would the clients be able to pick default options? What kind of overhead would that incur because then they\u2019re going outside of the enterprise network? What kind of legal ramification would that entail, is there a double-blind factor involved, whereas an outside intermediary I just go in and request verification, I don\u2019t care where it\u2019s going to, I don\u2019t care about access rights to the underlying data, or must I be granted access rights to the data to request verification? How would the verification process itself be secured? That would be my particular question. Questions from Mr. Du to DFINITY engineers and developers 1. How will consensus mechanisms fit into the Internet Computer framework? Will the participants obtain ownership of the content they created? 2.

He is a globally recognized automotive and mobility expert with nearly four decades of experience including 15+ years as an automotive executive, with 15+ years in China. Bill is also currently serving as the Chair of the Automotive Committee at the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai. Question 1 Lewis Could you briefly introduce yourself and your company Automobility? Mr. Russo Commercialization and democratization of mobility First of all, I\u2019m the founder and CEO of Automobility. Our business is mainly to help clients in both the corporate world as well as in the investment world to see through some of the fog that\u2019s there around how the transportation solutions are being upgraded with technology, and how do you build in profit from the opportunities that are presented within that. Many of those are technology-related, but they\u2019re not only about innovation, the creation of new technology, and the power of transportation but also how to commercialize it, how is it being commercialized in services. Because that I think the challenge we have had for a long time is building industries around profiting from selling products. What we\u2019ve learned in the internet era is that we\u2019re finding more efficient ways of delivering services to a population of people that now have the power of the internet in their pocket. It\u2019s no longer a gentrified world where only people who can afford to own the vehicle technology were the ones who benefited the most. Now everybody has access to mobility. Mobility isn\u2019t a product to own but a platform to serve us. It\u2019s a mechanism to make our lives easier, and allow us to experience more, to be able to access more. We\u2019re democratizing, that is the opposite of gentrification. Gentrification means it\u2019s available to the privileged few. Democratization means it\u2019s available to everyone. Everyone who has basic access to the platform, right. So our business in Automobility, is really to challenge the conventional thinking. The conventional thinking of an industry called automotive, to think about itself not as a product, but as a utility, as a service, and the service of mobility. The service of whatever product that moves people or moves things is mobility, it\u2019s movement. So that\u2019s what we specialize in. Figure 2: Automobility Experience in the automotive industry I\u2019ve been in China for 17 years. My business while in China and before was always serving the automotive sector. I\u2019m currently chairing the automotive committee at the American Chamber of Commerce here in Shanghai, which is a great opportunity to kind of sit right at the crossroads of the global and China intersection of how the world sees the future and how China sees the future. And China has a very different way, as we all know, of thinking about how to commercialize technology. So I get to kind of help clients understand China better, and how it goes about commercializing new ideas. Before coming here. I was Head of Strategy at Chrysler, a multinational car company. And early in my career, I actually worked at IBM. IBM is obviously a computer company that also went through disruption. That industry was technology-based, but it had to go through a transformation when the personal computer came along. The devices that we carry democratize Information Technology. Once upon a time when you were very young [1] , when I was just starting my career, even before you were born probably, Information Technology was not in our pocket. It was in a data center. And people had to know how to program a computer to get useful utility from the computer. It wasn\u2019t opening a device with your face, clicking a few buttons, and have all the information you need presented to you on a convenient little screen that you carry in your pocket. No, you had to know how to get the information out of the computer, you had to be an Information Systems professional. So that industry with the power of technology was transformed from a privileged few to everybody having access. I think that\u2019s what\u2019s happening to the automotive industry. It\u2019s going through that similar transformation with a lot of the same technology and tools. So our business is helping clients understand how this industry is being transformed. Helping clients ride the waves of disruption We see it through the electrification of the powertrain system. That\u2019s probably the most deeply rooted thing that this industry or any industry has had. Think about this: the backbone technology, the intellectual property that powers mobility, was invented in the 19th century. 1885 was when the internal combustion engine was first installed in a vehicle. 136 years later, where 95% of the cars even today, maybe not in China, but 88% of the cars in China still are sold with a technology that was originally invented in 1885. It\u2019s time we change that. That\u2019s just the first wave and one of the waves of disruption that\u2019s changing the mobility landscape. The other wave is the self-driving vehicle. And that\u2019s also going to be commercialized here very rapidly. Question 2 Lewis What are the current challenges to achieving large-scale sustainable mobility? What are some feasible solutions? Mr. Russo Incumbent legacy and economics The biggest challenges are in legacy and economics. Technology barriers can be overcome if there\u2019s favorable economics, it was always possible to power the wheels with something other than the combustion engine. But nothing was as economically advantaged as that. The reason why it dominated for so long is because you could scale it, the resources needed to refuel it were plentiful and relatively inexpensive. Henry Ford\u2019s innovation of the 20th century wasn\u2019t the internal combustion engine, it was the mass production business model applied to producing the automobile at scale. So the average person, middle-class person, not everyone, but the average person can afford it because it was built in a mass-production way. The ability to aggregate the supply chain, and you can drive down the unit cost of producing the product and make it affordable by somebody who has an average wage-earning job. That was the innovation of the 20th century. The innovation of the 19th century was originally the steam engine, followed by the internal combustion engine, which powered transportation for the 135 years of history of the automobile. But now we\u2019re in a new era. We\u2019re in an era where we have a legacy to overcome. We have economics at scale, which is the incumbent advantage. You have an industry that knows how to profit from the existing status-quo technology. What\u2019s the incentive for that industry to change to a less than fully scaled technology that they do not have the supply chain in place to build and profit from. That\u2019s why I say my theme is building and profiting from the future of mobility. Right now, the automotive industry builds in profits from the legacy of mobility, not the future. How do you build in profit from the future? Part of that shouldn\u2019t be the burden purely on the industry. Henry Ford didn\u2019t invent the mass-production model. He did a lot of things vertically integrated. He made tires and he did a lot of supply chain aggregation. But he wasn\u2019t an oil explorer, he didn\u2019t build the national highway road system. All of that is infrastructure. There were other companies to go explore and get access to the gasoline and build refineries. Standard Oil did that. The US has been very supportive of the carbon-based economy, and the supply chain of resources needed to power its industries. That\u2019s the old 20th century way of thinking. If in today\u2019s 21st-century world, you\u2019re trying to pivot to something more sustainable than fossil fuel carbon-based transportation, then you need a heavy amount of infrastructure backing for the new supply chain, for the resources needed to build the batteries, to build the components, to get access to the resource like the lithium and other ingredients that go into making the anode and the cathode. You need the infrastructure for charging in place, all of which doesn\u2019t come pure. It shouldn\u2019t come purely from the company that\u2019s inventing the device. Revolutions are not led by the king, but the ones that are not in power The automotive industry being a profit-making enterprise prioritizes things that they can profit from, and if the electric vehicle is less profitable, they do not put it as a priority for development. Unless you\u2019re only making electric vehicles. If you are an electric-vehicle-only company, you have no legacy to protect. You are a predator in the competitive landscape. It took a company like Tesla to reimagine the business model of how you build a profitable electric vehicle company. Very rarely does a revolution get led by the kings, the royal family, or the Emperor. Revolutions have to come from the ones who are not in power. And that\u2019s what\u2019s happening in the world of the automotive industry today. It\u2019s the startup companies that are the EV disruptors. In China, you could argue that it\u2019s Tesla, as well as NIO as well as XPENG as well as pure-play EV companies. But there\u2019s another revolution happening. And that\u2019s the digital revolution. And the digital revolution is played by a completely different set of rules. And they are not pure-play EV companies. These are companies that are born in the internet era with the idea of monetizing mobility and monetizing the movement. So they\u2019re not just thinking EV, they\u2019re gonna go EV because it makes sense for them to make to go EV. Why would you start a company in the 21st century, powered by a technology invented in the 19th century, it would be kind of crazy to do that. So any company invented or born in this era is going to be born with electric vehicle technology embedded in its blueprint for the future. But the other revolution is the digital revolution. And the digital revolution is not just about monetizing the sale of the vehicle. It\u2019s about monetizing the mobility and the data associated with the usage of the device itself. We are users of smart devices. When a car becomes a smart device, what can you do with the users in it, especially if they\u2019re not driving it? That user becomes a consumer of services, the services that you can present to them in the vehicle, the services that they can consume when they step out of the vehicle, or the services that the vehicle is enabling them to experience. So this is the world of the future. The world of the future is going to be a digital future. It\u2019s going to require electrification and self-driving technology. So that\u2019s where you see the new companies prioritizing. When you hear NIO, when you hear XPENG when you hear LI Autos talk, they\u2019re talking like digital companies. When you hear Tesla talk, you\u2019re talking like a tech company. Their business is to create the revolution. They are not in business to protect the legacy. Public-private partnership is the solution to infrastructure Public-private partnership is the formula that works. And it works everywhere in the world, I\u2019d say it\u2019s worked in the US and it\u2019s worked in Europe. The transportation infrastructure, which was once upon a time, gasoline refueling stations and physical roads infrastructure. Car companies don\u2019t have to build that. They shouldn\u2019t build that. So why should they build the charging infrastructure? Tesla did, and they built the supercharger network. Now you can participate in that if there\u2019s an economic benefit for you to do that. And I think in their case, they don\u2019t just see themselves as an EV company, they see themselves as an energy company. And having access to the charging system actually gives them a more frequent B2C [2] customer engagement than just selling them a car. If I sell you a car. I see you when you buy the car, maybe if it breaks down, you come back to me, and the customer\u2019s usually unhappy when that happens. But the everyday utility, where maybe two or three times a week you need to get your car charged, that\u2019s also a customer touchpoint. It\u2019s also a place where you can profit from the interaction. BP [3] knows this, I mean, what a convenience store next to the gasoline pump. You can sell people coffee, snacks, or whatever else you can do in a convenience store. Since cars used to break down more when they were mechanical in the 20th century, most of the places you stop to refuel are actually repair shops because you needed something else like checking your oil. I remember when I was young, you pull into a gas station, not only did you not have to pump it yourself somebody would pump the gas for you, they would check your oil, because they knew they could profit from selling you an oil change. So the B2C engagement point , the connectivity to the customer is also a reason why you might want to be in the business of servicing or charging the vehicles when they\u2019re moving around more frequently. Figure 3: A BP service store Fewer cars, more movement We live in a densely populated place, people don\u2019t like to be in the car and they don\u2019t like to be in traffic. They know they need to get around town but the experience of mobility can be painful if you\u2019re the person driving the vehicle. I think what we\u2019re evolving to is a world where we\u2019re not going to be actuating the machines ourselves, the machines will be moving all the time, probably without a driver. That\u2019s a not too distant future. And there won\u2019t be as many of them out there. Why? Because in a population as large as this, if everybody\u2019s driving their own machine, there are too many out there. There are just too many and we don\u2019t move around frequently enough to justify ourselves. If our average mobility pattern is say, one hour out of our 24 hour day, that we\u2019re physically moving, then if we\u2019re moving around on our own equipment, that\u2019s 95% of the assets that move us that are sitting not moving. That\u2019s not the way the future of transportation is going to work. They have to be moving constantly, either moving us or moving packages around, and only doing the productive work when it\u2019s moving. Anything that\u2019s unproductive and sitting part is just occupying space in the city. So if we\u2019re going to live in densely populated urban city centers, we shouldn\u2019t all be owning our own equipment. So the auto industry has to learn how to profit from the movement, not from the sale of the asset. If you\u2019re a mobility company, then you are trying to optimize the productivity of movement, not the productivity of your factory. That\u2019s what they optimize today. I know that their business is based on volume planning and product planning. How many can I build? At what price? And how much money do I make per unit? Which means I have to sell a lot of them. And you\u2019re not concerned about whether or not people use them frequently, because you don\u2019t profit from that. It\u2019s not your business. The downstream business is not your business. That\u2019s the part that I like about these new mobility companies: the Teslas, the NIOs, the XPENGS. They\u2019re not just thinking about how many can I sell. They think about how can I profit from what people do with them after they\u2019re sold. You have to think that that business is yours as well. Why would you design a city to prioritize space for storing underutilized assets? Unless your city is based on making those assets which could be an exceptional case. I know in the case of Liuzhou, where Wuling is based. I think 30% of the cars in the city are that model. It\u2019s very cheap. Look at the price, it\u2019s 37,600 Kuai. It\u2019s an EV base model, the more expensive one is 43,000 Kuai. Virtually anybody can afford that. 30% of the cars being sold are those. So the city now has the problem. Where do we store them all? It\u2019s like the shared bikes, where do you put them? Now they have a problem: where are we gonna put them because people don\u2019t use them that much. So it\u2019s a solution to the personal mobility problem. It\u2019s democratized so everyone can afford it. But is that a sustainable model for city development? Figure 4: This EV is ubiquitous in Liuzhou, China Prof. Luyao Zhang Exactly, especially in city centers like New York, it\u2019s very expensive to park. Mr. Russo Yeah, because they don\u2019t want you to take your car to the city. The way they prevent you from doing that is making it really expensive to park and making it really expensive to go over the bridge. Have you ever gone round trip over a bridge in New York City? It takes $20 to do that. Do that every day for a month, and you\u2019re basically working for the Bridge Authority. [ chuckles ] They\u2019re encouraging you to use other ways. Either live closer to where you work, which is also expensive, or give up taking the car that sits parked and take public transportation, or shared rides that pool the assets and make sure that they\u2019re moving all the time. So if cars moved all the time, we wouldn\u2019t need as many of them. But you also then need to solve the problem of how do I keep them moving, which means you have to charge them if they\u2019re EVs. And EVs have the problem that it takes four hours to charge them. That\u2019s downtime, you have to charge them fast. One of the reasons why NIO prioritizes battery swapping is it eliminates the problem of four hours of recharge. And that\u2019s I think that\u2019d be very popular here in China. It wouldn\u2019t have happened outside of China. It wanted to happen before, and there was even an Israeli startup that became a unicorn that tried to be a battery swapping company. But the automotive industry then 10 years ago wasn\u2019t ready for that technology. But in China where we have a completely different context of how people move, it is very much a benefit to have the ability to fast charge your car. The logistics industry is the driver for autonomous vehicles The other issue is self-driving technology. And I think that\u2019s where I think China really stands out to be the lead market for self-driving vehicles. First of all, I don\u2019t think the motivation to get behind the wheel and drive is as high here. Some people want to own a car for sure. But they don\u2019t want to drive it every day. They want to have it when they need it for occasional use. But manually actuating a vehicle is not the ambition. It\u2019s the ownership and the pride of ownership, not necessarily get me out in the traffic jam so that I can experience gridlock. I grew up in New York, I never really was motivated to go to Manhattan with my car. But if I needed to go out to the countryside, no problem, I\u2019ll take the car for that. So I think in China the use cases for mobility are going to determine what the type of solution is, but self driving is commercialized in a completely different way. And it\u2019s going to be mainly driven by the logistics economy, it\u2019s going to be mainly driven by e-commerce, by the food delivery, the robo delivery. Use case will be the commercial driver for the self-driving vehicle because I think when you talk about people movement, the hurdles are higher, you\u2019ve got occupant safety risk, the issue of responsibility for the safety of the occupant, there are going to be more regulations there. But I think for delivery applications, and for goods movement applications, they absolutely will be commercialized faster in China. Figure 5: A delivery robot in China Question 3 Lewis How do you envision the future of smart (tech-enabled) mobility with the democratization of advanced technology? Mr. Russo Technology abhors inefficiency First of all, technology doesn\u2019t discriminate. What technology does is it disrupts and finds ways to make things more efficient. Internet abhors inefficiency, and internet companies seek to disrupt inefficient business models, whether that\u2019s publishing, or music, or just pick a thing that required a physical product to be manufactured and sold in a retail way. The internet took out the inefficiency. If I had to physically print a book, sell it through a distributor to a book retailer, and then have you go to the bookstore, which we like to do. I certainly like to browse through physical books and I still do. But all of that inefficiency of the physical print, the factory to do that, the handling and intermediaries in between who each took a little bit more profit, at the end of the day, something that should cost a few dollars ends up costing $30 to buy a hardcover book from a bookstore. Amazon threw that business model away and said I\u2019m going to sell books online. I could do that with no physical factory to build the book, no distribution channel, just put the information online and you just download it and consume it through Amazon Kindle. But the bookstore still exists and there\u2019s still people still want to go have coffee. The bookstores became coffee shops, we like to hang out to see people and sometimes you want to touch it physically the leaf pages. I still liked reading the flaps. Some people even young people might still do it that way. But it\u2019s gonna get challenged by the new. That\u2019s where we are with the automotive industry. What we are pointing out is the inefficiency. The inefficiency was there all along. It was the 5% utilized car. If the way we become personally mobile, not public transport, but personally mobile, to get in our own personalized mobility experience, we had to physically buy a device, a bicycle, a car, we had to free ourselves up from the bus and the train, by physically buying hardware. The internet said no, I can give you that. Even if you\u2019re a taxi hailing person, you don\u2019t have to stand in the border and get elbowed out by somebody else who jumps in front of you and grabs that taxi. You just tell the app and that\u2019s your ride. There\u2019s no more competition on the street. When I lived in Beijing on Changanjie, and I had to position myself in a way where I was able to not get on the taxi line, because you\u2019re going to have 15 people waiting at the taxi stand in front of you. So you end up standing maybe 20\u201330 meters in front of the taxi line and try to grab the taxi before everybody else. This is China, we\u2019re all competing for space and there\u2019s no such thing as Pai Dui (waiting in line); wherever there\u2019s Pai Dui, there\u2019s a Jia San (cutting in line) and there\u2019s somebody who will come in and say \u201cokay, I\u2019m gonna grab that spot\u201d, whether it\u2019s waiting for a taxi or Uber, or applying for college or anything else that you might do, there\u2019s always five other people that want to do it in front of you. [ chuckles ] The Internet sees the inefficiency and says I can serve and give you a more personalized experience, and you don\u2019t have to stand in line anymore. You might have to outbid someone online but that\u2019s the profit of the internet company. So it sees that and recognizes mobility as a service. Tech companies think differently I had the experience of meeting Cheng Wei [4] . And I brought a car company to meet him in 2015. It was the CEO of Ford China that went to Beijing with me. After they shook hands, he (Cheng Wei) said, it\u2019s great to meet a famous company like Ford, we are in the same business. And the Ford CEO said: \u201creally? We\u2019re a manufacturing company and you\u2019re an app. How are we in the same business?\u201d Cheng Wei said: \u201cWell, Henry Ford democratized mobility with mass production, and we\u2019re democratizing mobility with an app. \u201d Figure 6: DIDI\u2019s founder and CEO, Cheng Wei And I thought, wow, that defines what the internet\u2019s doing. This is the automotive industry, I\u2019m not in the business of the utility, I\u2019m in the business of the product. I\u2019m making a mobility device but I\u2019m not profiting from its movement. So the internet economy sees the inefficiency and says, I\u2019m going to blow that away. I don\u2019t need a factory. You can be the factory for me. Like Ford, you can build a car, and I tell you what a person who I put in the car might want to do when they\u2019re in it and build me that car. Or maybe we can help the cars that are in service use your dealership network or some type of service network. So you have to come at the problem thinking differently. And that\u2019s what the internet companies are doing. When you look at NIO, when you look at at Apple, when you look at Waymo, they\u2019re solving a different problem. First question you have to ask is why are these companies experimenting mobility? What did they want? And the answer most people give, which is the wrong answer, is maybe they want to become car companies. No, I don\u2019t think so. Who wants to be a manufacturing company? They want they see what human beings do every day. And they say, how can I make that better? From problems to tech-enabled solution What Didi did is they see what human beings do everyday, they move around every day, they don\u2019t necessarily like to go on the train, they don\u2019t necessarily want to go on a bus, they don\u2019t like standing in a taxi queue, and I have a technology solution for that. So if you\u2019re Apple, or if you\u2019re Waymo and you say, I\u2019m in the business of monetizing online services. If you are Google, what do people do every day? They move around. How do I capture that user as part of my Android operating system? I\u2019m Apple. What do people do every day? They listen to music, they make phone calls, they they take pictures, and they move around. So mobility is always on the list of what we do every day: we order food, there\u2019s Alibaba; we cook, there\u2019s Hema [5] . The internect company sees what we do every day, and it monetizes us with a service that makes it easier for us to do that. And if there\u2019s an inefficiency in the business of delivering that service to us, they attack it. What\u2019s the inefficiency in transportation today? Fuel cost, maintenance cost and driver cost. How do you mitigate that? Electric and autonomous vehicles. So you get quickly to the answer if you think in the in the digital context. Self-driving technology, connectivity, and operating systems The first wave of disruption of the automotive industry was mobility as a service; the second wave of disruption is electric and connected vehicle technology. We\u2019re in that era right now. We\u2019re in the advent of electrification and early stages of self-driving technology. It\u2019s called ADAS \u2014 Advanced Driver Assistance System. China likes to call it ICV \u2014 Intelligent Connected Vehicle. Same thing but different names. But it brings the idea of connectivity into the equation. And when you bring connectivity into the equation, you bring the operating systems into play. IOS, Android, Harmony OS, that\u2019s why Huawei is in the game; Duer OS, that\u2019s why Baidu is in the game; Ali OS, that\u2019s why Alibaba is in the game; MIUI, that\u2019s why Lei Jun [6] is in the game. Pick a device, and then say is the automobile a device? What operating system should power it? Mine, if you\u2019re an internet company. So it\u2019s only a matter of time until all of the tech companies are in some level in the future of mobility. The car is the most sophisticated computer that we will interact with on a day to day basis. Who wants to be the operating system that powers the apps that are presenting the applications to the users in the everyday computer that they\u2019re being transported in? The answer is every single tech company . [ chuckles ] Figure 7: NIO OS and its center console Prof. Luyao Zhang This sounds interesting, because we were doing research about the decentralized finance application on the blockchain. But you help me see another user case: a car is also like a platform. Mr. Russo Not only is it a smart device, it\u2019s probably one of the most personalized and immersive spaces outside of our living room. It\u2019s probably going to be the most personalizable space. Even our workplaces is less personalized, because we share it with with others. But when we\u2019re in that vehicle, that\u2019s our box, that\u2019s our cave. And it doesn\u2019t have to be ours for the time that we\u2019re in it. The technology is sophisticated enough to know who we are with facial recognition, you just have to sit in it for the device to know who you are. What\u2019s the difference between shared mobility and personal mobility? The difference is there\u2019s somebody driving a car where I have never met before. The other thing is, I\u2019m never going to remember this car 10 minutes after I get out of it because they didn\u2019t personalize. But you will remember it when it\u2019s personalized. That\u2019s what the internet knows how to do. They know how to make the services sticky. The successful internet companies are the ones that you miss when you don\u2019t have it. The reason why people buy a device is because of the operating system and because they know their cloud storage, their photos and music, whatever they prefer, whether it\u2019s harmony OS or IOS. You will be making a decision of what car to get on the basis of what operating system it has. I posted something online on LinkedIn about BYD. Somebody said I would want a BYD, but it doesn\u2019t have Harmony OS. I\u2019ve been saying this a long time, people will make a decision of what car to either own or use based on what experience they\u2019re going to have in it, and the operating system is what defines the personalized experience of mobility. Transportation device as an experience Prof. Luyao Zhang I feel like it\u2019s similar to the thing you mentioned about parking lot. Because right now we are taking Didi for the convenience of doing something else, but the process is actually redundant. What if the process of transportation is also itself a valuable experience? Mr. Russo Think about your hospitality industry. If we\u2019re in business traveling, you book a hotel because it\u2019s in the city that you\u2019re going to. It just happens to be convenient for you to be going to that particular place. But there were destination hotels, you go there because of what it is. It is something very popular here in China, people go on weekend trips in their home city. It\u2019s become very popular even now during COVID because of the travel restrictions. I don\u2019t want to be in my home all the time. I\u2019ll go book a weekend in Chongming [7] . I went out to Thousand Island with my daughter and we never really left. There\u2019s this beautiful lake there. We went outside once and we spent the rest of time in the hotel, because there\u2019s a children\u2019s play area and there\u2019s a lady making syrupy angels. [ chuckles ] There was so much to do she never left. And till this day my daughter was three years old and she was two years old when we went. She still calls it daddy\u2019s hotel. The funny thing is we may think of mobility that way, not too far in the future, where you can create an experience and make that the reason you got in it. You just need another space. Community / Brand culture is the game-changer I think there\u2019s a seed of that in the NIO\u2019s business design. A lot of people buying NIO are not buying just because of the car. It\u2019s an EV, but it\u2019s also a community. William Li [8] did something with NIO day. I went to one of them, the one that they had here in Shanghai with Bruno Mars. It was a cult. It was like we were all NIO enthusiasts. And then he builds this NIO house, which is basically a club. So when you\u2019re thinking do I buy a Tesla or a NIO, and you\u2019re Chinese, and you\u2019re thinking, \u201cthat one\u2019s got a more famous multinational brand, but this one has people I can meet, I can socialize with, I get invited to go see Bruno Mars or whomever\u201d. So you\u2019ve created a community. You\u2019ve created a culture. We did that a little bit at Chrysler with Jeep, the Camp Jeep where if you own a Jeep, you can go and take it out in the off road experience. Thousands of people every year would go to Camp Jeep. I think there\u2019s a bit of that in the DNA of the internet company, because it\u2019s social communities and it\u2019s online attachment. If I can build that feature around my mobility experience, then I have a reason to stay with the brand. It\u2019s no longer just having a physical device but there are things that the physical device enables in my lifestyle that I can let go of. That\u2019s the part that I think the digital economy will invent a way for people to remember the mobility experience more than they remember the hardware itself. They need to attach it somehow to the hardware, and they need to make the experience so unique, where I can\u2019t not have that . Apple enthusiasts sometimes are called Apple fanboys, that they\u2019re so devoted to the brand where they have to have all the latest and greatest stuff, and they are constantly looking for upgrades. Or you\u2019ll even go to the store not intending to buy anything, but rather just enjoy going to the store. You\u2019re sucked into this community of people that like to brag about all the cool technology. And I think that\u2019s where you\u2019re going to see this industry evolve is these smart device companies, who, by the way, have stores. For traditional cars, you\u2019d never go to the dealership. The most horrible experience about ownership is buying the car and getting it serviced. So the dealership is not a fun place to go. It\u2019s like going to the dentist. [ chuckles ] You are like: do I really have to do this? I got to get my teeth cleaned every now and then but do I really get excited about the idea of going there? No. That\u2019s the car dealership to the car owner. However, that\u2019s not the Tesla store. That\u2019s not the NIO store. It\u2019s like people just want to go in there because it looks like: hey, people are having some fun and cool stuff in there. If you go over here on Corporate Avenue five, go to the HiFi store. I put my little girl in there and it\u2019s got this wacky vehicle design. It\u2019s got these goldwing kind of doors that fly up. But when you get in the car, it\u2019s got this, and this is what the Chinese brands I think are very different than the foreign companies is they got these gigantic screens in front of you. And I put my three-year-old daughter in the passenger seat and she knew how to tap, swipe, and find what she wanted. She found Paw Patrol and it was just lots of watching. I can\u2019t get her out of the car. It\u2019s like she knows how to do this. I put her in a Tesla. She got behind the wheel. And within two seconds she\u2019s tapping and she\u2019s learning how to turn the radio on. I didn\u2019t tell her to do any of this stuff. I put her in the NIO car. If you want to see how the future is going to be like, take a little child and put them in a car and look at what they do. They go right for the screen. The other thing NIO did is they put a little robot sitting there called Nomi, which you can talk to. And when you ask it to play music, not only does it blink and smile at you, a little guitar comes out. It\u2019s got a little animation of the guitar playing while the music is playing. I got her out of the car and I went to another shopping mall and it was a Ford. I\u2019m not downplaying Ford but I put her in the Ford. She didn\u2019t want to stay in the car. There was no screen. And she asked me where\u2019s Nomi? Where\u2019s the little face? Where\u2019s my little robot that I can talk to? And I\u2019m thinking the traditional car companies are not in sync with where this world is going. Figure 8: NOMI-NIO\u2019s cute in-car AI assistant Customer segmentation leads to multi-brand strategy I was invited to Ningbo by Geely to experience their new car, Zeeker. They put me into the new Zeeker car. Also, mind-blowing performance and giant screen. You can have a comfortable ride, you can have a performance ride, you can change the driving experience. That\u2019s a neat idea. It also had a giant screen. So I asked him first of all, why do you have so many brands. He said in China, there\u2019s so many different segments in the market so you need to be able to speak to the customers in a more granular level. Having one brand to cover everything is not appropriate. That\u2019s counterintuitive logic to the way the multinational car companies have thought. They approached multi-brand strategy in a different way. They saw it as a way of standardizing on the manufacturing line with a common set of technologies and then creating prices and life stage brands with different levels of content for different lifestyles. So if you\u2019re GM, you start with a Chevrolet and then maybe you graduate to a Pontiac, a Buick, Oldsmobile, and a Cadillac. Basically, it\u2019s the same car. It just had different top hat and different interior. You might have leather, you might have something else. You had something that differentiated it, but everything under the covers was the same. The chassis was the same. Even today you see a Toyota has Lexus, but the Lexus cars are basically the same as Toyota cars but just with more leather in it. In China, these brands are targeting totally different customers. The GreatWall brand has TANK, they even have a pickup truck brand. Now they have HAVAL, they have WEY and they have ORA [9] . And the ORA brand is totally targeted at young, 20 to 35 years old buyers. EV in China is going to be sold to the younger technology savvy population. The way it\u2019s being done elsewhere is through price premium. You can get a Volkswagen, or you can get a Volkswagen electric. The latter is going to cost more. You got the world upside down here. If you price it higher, you\u2019re not going to appeal to the younger buyer. You\u2019re trying to sell it to the older buyer because they have more money. You don\u2019t want to be that cheap ( referring to the previous Wuling EV that\u2019s priced at RMB 30k ). That\u2019s too democratized. You want to make money at it. But take the Geely approach. Let\u2019s create a brand. Let\u2019s call it something that you\u2019ll notice. What is a Zeeker? So I asked them what Zeeker is. \u201cZ\u201d for Generation Z, \u201ceek\u201d is geek, what\u2019s the Generation Z geek? It\u2019s a Zeeker. So they\u2019re basically saying to you, \u201cI\u2019m selling EVs to the younger population\u201d, which is exactly the way you should be doing it. Because the younger people are going to be more tech savvy. They\u2019re going to not want to have what their mom and pop had, if their mom and pop even owned a car. If they didn\u2019t own a car, they\u2019re definitely going to want to have an EV. Anybody who\u2019s probably born in this century is probably far less likely to buy a combustion engine powered vehicle than an EV. So let\u2019s name a brand after them. Question 4 Lewis With the rapidly changing and diversifying landscape of the automobile industry, how do you think talents and scholars should prepare to make an impact in the industry? Mr. Russo The connectivity between industry and academic institutions I was talking to somebody recently, whose son is about to go to university. And he was having a debate with his son over what to major in. His son wants to be in the automotive industry. And he couldn\u2019t convince the son to not major in mechanical engineering. He is saying the higher priced graduates are the ones who have the skills needed for the electronics, the software, and the self driving technology. He is an investor so he kind of knows where the money\u2019s going. It\u2019s not in mechanical engineering. It is a dilemma for the automotive industry, because the automotive industry tends to be served by the universities that surround it. In the automotive centers of the world, the technical universities in Germany, even in the US, University of Michigan, Michigan State University, Ohio State University, those universities have a strong mechanical engineering, deeply rooted academic bias. There\u2019s a reason why Stanford and MIT, which are long standing academic institutions, but they\u2019re not in the backyard of an industry that is deeply rooted in a particular discipline. And you\u2019ve got the other added benefit of new tech. The venture capital world surrounds the academic institutions that breed the kinds of technologies that are needed in the future, because the venture world is about the future. It\u2019s not about preserving the past. So this is the dilemma that the automotive industry faces. The institutions that support it, which include academia are geared to the old legacy, not to the next generation. And it lacks in many of those locations, the vibrancy of a deep pocketed venture capital, risk hungry venture capital world. The automotive industry\u2019s business model is rooted in a risk-averse financial system. Taking on risk is the purpose of venture capital, it\u2019s to absorb the risk. It\u2019s to say, \u201cI accept the fact that 9 out of 10 are going to fail\u201d, because it\u2019s the 10th one that\u2019s going to make back all the money. And that\u2019s what Stanford represents, that\u2019s what MIT represents as a breeding ground for the next generation of tech. I would argue that Carnegie Mellon. There\u2019s a bastion of hope in the upper Midwest, and that the AV (autonomous vehicles) tech, the Pittsburgh Cleveland corridor did find some backing with the autonomous vehicle development coming out of their academic institutions. But the academic institutions have to see beyond the incumbent companies to the next generation of technology startups, and gravitate to orbiting these very small dust clouds, which eventually will be the the burning stars of the future of mobility. Figure 9: Stanford\u2019s autonomous vehicle That\u2019s why Tesla is in California, and that\u2019s why California is such a hotbed for talent. That\u2019s why even the Chinese EV companies need to go to California. It\u2019s because you\u2019ve got the AV talent coming from there. You\u2019ve got the Googles of the world, the Apples of the world that are the next generation of mobility disruption companies. You\u2019ve got all the AV tech companies that test their vehicles in that area. You need to spot the trend and reform the academics. I don\u2019t want to say all academia is this way, but they tend to gravitate to where they get funded. And sometimes they get funded by old institutions that are not trying to reform the industries that they serve. Prof. Luyao Zhang Yeah, I really feel this. I gave up a lot of fundings because the project is not interesting. But a lot of professors cannot see this. Mr. Russo But there\u2019s always going to be fundings, because even the oldest institutions have big R&D centers. They do. Volkswagen has labs here and they have huge R&D investments. But the question is, Will the king create the revolution? All you gotta do is look at the sales performance of Volkswagens EVs in China and compare it to NIO. Volkswagen sold fewer with far more dealers. How is that possible? If I\u2019m in Wolfsburg [10] I\u2019m really panicking right now, because this is their biggest market. I\u2019m sure Tongji university with Volkswagens backing is doing a lot of cool R&D. But how much of that is finally going to find its way to commercial scale if they can\u2019t figure out how to climb the hill in China. They\u2019ll be able to do that in Europe, because buyers of Volkswagen products in Europe are not going to think anything different about Volkswagen as an EV company. They\u2019ll say, \u201cokay I\u2019m fine with that\u201d. But this is China. I think Chinese, you\u2019re gonna have a different buyer of EV than traditional cars. And the people buying EVs are shopping TESLA, they\u2019re shopping the new stuff. Then if they\u2019re not happy with that they might go back and look at Volkswagen and look at their EV. But I don\u2019t think so. I think they\u2019re totally different buyers. Volkswagen might sell that EV to somebody in their 50s who can afford it, who might be a little bit more tech savvy than somebody else in his age demographic. But the 35 year old, 30 year old or the 25 year old, they\u2019re looking to NIO, they\u2019re looking at XPENG, they\u2019re looking at the Chinese brands, Entrepreneurship in Israel I look at Israel, which is a small market that has to be global in the way they think. And they do a very good job at the academic institution level of incubating new startups. And then they create support structures for the startups in their early stage like incubators. But they are also backed by local venture investments that can bring these young plants to a level where they can be, at some point, competitive in the forest. You need that kind of system, and the university shouldn be the incubators. It\u2019s not because they\u2019re demographically young. You\u2019ll find 50, 60 years old entrepreneurs, they\u2019ve just done this their whole life. They\u2019ve started several different companies. And that makes them even more valuable, because they know how to get funded, how to work through the system, they know how to sell the company to a company that can help them scale. So they\u2019re really good at it. And I think it\u2019s that startup and venture backed ecosystem, with the universities as a breeding ground. There has to be some form to do that. Prof. Luyao Zhang All my advisors are Jewish, so I\u2019m familiar with the community. And one thing that really impressed me is that they are all entrepreneurs their whole lives. Mr. Russo There\u2019ll be some brilliant CTO who\u2019s 25 years old, came out of the military. But then the CEO or the advisors are all 50-year-old, 60-year-old people, but they still have that youthful enthusiasm for technology, right? Because they\u2019ve been doing it their whole life, ce, but not anybody older than me would have brought up in the Cultural Revolution. In Israel, they\u2019re born to be entrepreneurs, and they live their whole life with that mindset, that entrepreneurial mindset. What\u2019s refreshing about China is that the young generation of entrepreneurs are not bound by legacy. They\u2019re not. They\u2019re not stuck in serving the traditional industries. That\u2019s the problem, not as much in the US but definitely in Europe. The academic institutions are geared to the traditional industries. Even today, the world has moved to digital, the movie world has moved to software defined. Europe is so far behind that. Even I\u2019d say Japan is behind that. East Asian countries that grew up in the late 20th century, mimicked the West. And I would say, watch out for Vietnam, and Vietnam is going to be the Asian tiger that rises after China, and will probably embed the best of both worlds. They\u2019re not coming here, they\u2019re going to go to Europe, and they\u2019re going to go to us. They might have even more success doing that than Chinese companies will because of geopolitics. Forget the fact that America might have fought a war in Vietnam, it doesn\u2019t matter for American car buyers that a car was built in Vietnam, but it will matter more if it was built in China, just because of the geopolitics. But Americans totally don\u2019t discriminate when it comes to what they buy. They can be a Trump supporter and still drive a Toyota. When they buy stuff, what they buy has nothing to do with their politics. It really doesn\u2019t. They\u2019ll go to Walmart, they\u2019ll buy everything that\u2019s made in China.

Our business is mainly to help clients in both the corporate world as well as in the investment world to see through some of the fog that\u2019s there around how the transportation solutions are being upgraded with technology, and how do you build in profit from the opportunities that are presented within that. Many of those are technology-related, but they\u2019re not only about innovation, the creation of new technology, and the power of transportation but also how to commercialize it, how is it being commercialized in services. Because that I think the challenge we have had for a long time is building industries around profiting from selling products. What we\u2019ve learned in the internet era is that we\u2019re finding more efficient ways of delivering services to a population of people that now have the power of the internet in their pocket. It\u2019s no longer a gentrified world where only people who can afford to own the vehicle technology were the ones who benefited the most. Now everybody has access to mobility. Mobility isn\u2019t a product to own but a platform to serve us. It\u2019s a mechanism to make our lives easier, and allow us to experience more, to be able to access more. We\u2019re democratizing, that is the opposite of gentrification. Gentrification means it\u2019s available to the privileged few. Democratization means it\u2019s available to everyone. Everyone who has basic access to the platform, right. So our business in Automobility, is really to challenge the conventional thinking. The conventional thinking of an industry called automotive, to think about itself not as a product, but as a utility, as a service, and the service of mobility. The service of whatever product that moves people or moves things is mobility, it\u2019s movement. So that\u2019s what we specialize in. Figure 2: Automobility Experience in the automotive industry I\u2019ve been in China for 17 years. My business while in China and before was always serving the automotive sector. I\u2019m currently chairing the automotive committee at the American Chamber of Commerce here in Shanghai, which is a great opportunity to kind of sit right at the crossroads of the global and China intersection of how the world sees the future and how China sees the future. And China has a very different way, as we all know, of thinking about how to commercialize technology. So I get to kind of help clients understand China better, and how it goes about commercializing new ideas. Before coming here. I was Head of Strategy at Chrysler, a multinational car company. And early in my career, I actually worked at IBM. IBM is obviously a computer company that also went through disruption. That industry was technology-based, but it had to go through a transformation when the personal computer came along. The devices that we carry democratize Information Technology. Once upon a time when you were very young [1] , when I was just starting my career, even before you were born probably, Information Technology was not in our pocket. It was in a data center. And people had to know how to program a computer to get useful utility from the computer. It wasn\u2019t opening a device with your face, clicking a few buttons, and have all the information you need presented to you on a convenient little screen that you carry in your pocket. No, you had to know how to get the information out of the computer, you had to be an Information Systems professional. So that industry with the power of technology was transformed from a privileged few to everybody having access. I think that\u2019s what\u2019s happening to the automotive industry. It\u2019s going through that similar transformation with a lot of the same technology and tools. So our business is helping clients understand how this industry is being transformed. Helping clients ride the waves of disruption We see it through the electrification of the powertrain system. That\u2019s probably the most deeply rooted thing that this industry or any industry has had. Think about this: the backbone technology, the intellectual property that powers mobility, was invented in the 19th century. 1885 was when the internal combustion engine was first installed in a vehicle. 136 years later, where 95% of the cars even today, maybe not in China, but 88% of the cars in China still are sold with a technology that was originally invented in 1885. It\u2019s time we change that. That\u2019s just the first wave and one of the waves of disruption that\u2019s changing the mobility landscape. The other wave is the self-driving vehicle. And that\u2019s also going to be commercialized here very rapidly.","title":"Mr. Russo"},{"location":"articles/AMA/TheFutureofMobility/#question-2","text":"","title":"Question 2"},{"location":"articles/AMA/TheFutureofMobility/#lewis_1","text":"What are the current challenges to achieving large-scale sustainable mobility? What are some feasible solutions?","title":"Lewis"},{"location":"articles/AMA/TheFutureofMobility/#mr-russo_1","text":"Incumbent legacy and economics The biggest challenges are in legacy and economics. Technology barriers can be overcome if there\u2019s favorable economics, it was always possible to power the wheels with something other than the combustion engine. But nothing was as economically advantaged as that. The reason why it dominated for so long is because you could scale it, the resources needed to refuel it were plentiful and relatively inexpensive. Henry Ford\u2019s innovation of the 20th century wasn\u2019t the internal combustion engine, it was the mass production business model applied to producing the automobile at scale. So the average person, middle-class person, not everyone, but the average person can afford it because it was built in a mass-production way. The ability to aggregate the supply chain, and you can drive down the unit cost of producing the product and make it affordable by somebody who has an average wage-earning job. That was the innovation of the 20th century. The innovation of the 19th century was originally the steam engine, followed by the internal combustion engine, which powered transportation for the 135 years of history of the automobile. But now we\u2019re in a new era. We\u2019re in an era where we have a legacy to overcome. We have economics at scale, which is the incumbent advantage. You have an industry that knows how to profit from the existing status-quo technology. What\u2019s the incentive for that industry to change to a less than fully scaled technology that they do not have the supply chain in place to build and profit from. That\u2019s why I say my theme is building and profiting from the future of mobility. Right now, the automotive industry builds in profits from the legacy of mobility, not the future. How do you build in profit from the future? Part of that shouldn\u2019t be the burden purely on the industry. Henry Ford didn\u2019t invent the mass-production model. He did a lot of things vertically integrated. He made tires and he did a lot of supply chain aggregation. But he wasn\u2019t an oil explorer, he didn\u2019t build the national highway road system. All of that is infrastructure. There were other companies to go explore and get access to the gasoline and build refineries. Standard Oil did that. The US has been very supportive of the carbon-based economy, and the supply chain of resources needed to power its industries. That\u2019s the old 20th century way of thinking. If in today\u2019s 21st-century world, you\u2019re trying to pivot to something more sustainable than fossil fuel carbon-based transportation, then you need a heavy amount of infrastructure backing for the new supply chain, for the resources needed to build the batteries, to build the components, to get access to the resource like the lithium and other ingredients that go into making the anode and the cathode. You need the infrastructure for charging in place, all of which doesn\u2019t come pure. It shouldn\u2019t come purely from the company that\u2019s inventing the device. Revolutions are not led by the king, but the ones that are not in power The automotive industry being a profit-making enterprise prioritizes things that they can profit from, and if the electric vehicle is less profitable, they do not put it as a priority for development. Unless you\u2019re only making electric vehicles. If you are an electric-vehicle-only company, you have no legacy to protect. You are a predator in the competitive landscape. It took a company like Tesla to reimagine the business model of how you build a profitable electric vehicle company. Very rarely does a revolution get led by the kings, the royal family, or the Emperor. Revolutions have to come from the ones who are not in power. And that\u2019s what\u2019s happening in the world of the automotive industry today. It\u2019s the startup companies that are the EV disruptors. In China, you could argue that it\u2019s Tesla, as well as NIO as well as XPENG as well as pure-play EV companies. But there\u2019s another revolution happening. And that\u2019s the digital revolution. And the digital revolution is played by a completely different set of rules. And they are not pure-play EV companies. These are companies that are born in the internet era with the idea of monetizing mobility and monetizing the movement. So they\u2019re not just thinking EV, they\u2019re gonna go EV because it makes sense for them to make to go EV. Why would you start a company in the 21st century, powered by a technology invented in the 19th century, it would be kind of crazy to do that. So any company invented or born in this era is going to be born with electric vehicle technology embedded in its blueprint for the future. But the other revolution is the digital revolution. And the digital revolution is not just about monetizing the sale of the vehicle. It\u2019s about monetizing the mobility and the data associated with the usage of the device itself. We are users of smart devices. When a car becomes a smart device, what can you do with the users in it, especially if they\u2019re not driving it? That user becomes a consumer of services, the services that you can present to them in the vehicle, the services that they can consume when they step out of the vehicle, or the services that the vehicle is enabling them to experience. So this is the world of the future. The world of the future is going to be a digital future. It\u2019s going to require electrification and self-driving technology. So that\u2019s where you see the new companies prioritizing. When you hear NIO, when you hear XPENG when you hear LI Autos talk, they\u2019re talking like digital companies. When you hear Tesla talk, you\u2019re talking like a tech company. Their business is to create the revolution. They are not in business to protect the legacy. Public-private partnership is the solution to infrastructure Public-private partnership is the formula that works. And it works everywhere in the world, I\u2019d say it\u2019s worked in the US and it\u2019s worked in Europe. The transportation infrastructure, which was once upon a time, gasoline refueling stations and physical roads infrastructure. Car companies don\u2019t have to build that. They shouldn\u2019t build that. So why should they build the charging infrastructure? Tesla did, and they built the supercharger network. Now you can participate in that if there\u2019s an economic benefit for you to do that. And I think in their case, they don\u2019t just see themselves as an EV company, they see themselves as an energy company. And having access to the charging system actually gives them a more frequent B2C [2] customer engagement than just selling them a car. If I sell you a car. I see you when you buy the car, maybe if it breaks down, you come back to me, and the customer\u2019s usually unhappy when that happens. But the everyday utility, where maybe two or three times a week you need to get your car charged, that\u2019s also a customer touchpoint. It\u2019s also a place where you can profit from the interaction. BP [3] knows this, I mean, what a convenience store next to the gasoline pump. You can sell people coffee, snacks, or whatever else you can do in a convenience store. Since cars used to break down more when they were mechanical in the 20th century, most of the places you stop to refuel are actually repair shops because you needed something else like checking your oil. I remember when I was young, you pull into a gas station, not only did you not have to pump it yourself somebody would pump the gas for you, they would check your oil, because they knew they could profit from selling you an oil change. So the B2C engagement point , the connectivity to the customer is also a reason why you might want to be in the business of servicing or charging the vehicles when they\u2019re moving around more frequently. Figure 3: A BP service store Fewer cars, more movement We live in a densely populated place, people don\u2019t like to be in the car and they don\u2019t like to be in traffic. They know they need to get around town but the experience of mobility can be painful if you\u2019re the person driving the vehicle. I think what we\u2019re evolving to is a world where we\u2019re not going to be actuating the machines ourselves, the machines will be moving all the time, probably without a driver. That\u2019s a not too distant future. And there won\u2019t be as many of them out there. Why? Because in a population as large as this, if everybody\u2019s driving their own machine, there are too many out there. There are just too many and we don\u2019t move around frequently enough to justify ourselves. If our average mobility pattern is say, one hour out of our 24 hour day, that we\u2019re physically moving, then if we\u2019re moving around on our own equipment, that\u2019s 95% of the assets that move us that are sitting not moving. That\u2019s not the way the future of transportation is going to work. They have to be moving constantly, either moving us or moving packages around, and only doing the productive work when it\u2019s moving. Anything that\u2019s unproductive and sitting part is just occupying space in the city. So if we\u2019re going to live in densely populated urban city centers, we shouldn\u2019t all be owning our own equipment. So the auto industry has to learn how to profit from the movement, not from the sale of the asset. If you\u2019re a mobility company, then you are trying to optimize the productivity of movement, not the productivity of your factory. That\u2019s what they optimize today. I know that their business is based on volume planning and product planning. How many can I build? At what price? And how much money do I make per unit? Which means I have to sell a lot of them. And you\u2019re not concerned about whether or not people use them frequently, because you don\u2019t profit from that. It\u2019s not your business. The downstream business is not your business. That\u2019s the part that I like about these new mobility companies: the Teslas, the NIOs, the XPENGS. They\u2019re not just thinking about how many can I sell. They think about how can I profit from what people do with them after they\u2019re sold. You have to think that that business is yours as well. Why would you design a city to prioritize space for storing underutilized assets? Unless your city is based on making those assets which could be an exceptional case. I know in the case of Liuzhou, where Wuling is based. I think 30% of the cars in the city are that model. It\u2019s very cheap. Look at the price, it\u2019s 37,600 Kuai. It\u2019s an EV base model, the more expensive one is 43,000 Kuai. Virtually anybody can afford that. 30% of the cars being sold are those. So the city now has the problem. Where do we store them all? It\u2019s like the shared bikes, where do you put them? Now they have a problem: where are we gonna put them because people don\u2019t use them that much. So it\u2019s a solution to the personal mobility problem. It\u2019s democratized so everyone can afford it. But is that a sustainable model for city development? Figure 4: This EV is ubiquitous in Liuzhou, China","title":"Mr. Russo"},{"location":"articles/AMA/TheFutureofMobility/#prof-luyao-zhang","text":"Exactly, especially in city centers like New York, it\u2019s very expensive to park.","title":"Prof. Luyao Zhang"},{"location":"articles/AMA/TheFutureofMobility/#mr-russo_2","text":"Yeah, because they don\u2019t want you to take your car to the city. The way they prevent you from doing that is making it really expensive to park and making it really expensive to go over the bridge. Have you ever gone round trip over a bridge in New York City? It takes $20 to do that. Do that every day for a month, and you\u2019re basically working for the Bridge Authority. [ chuckles ] They\u2019re encouraging you to use other ways. Either live closer to where you work, which is also expensive, or give up taking the car that sits parked and take public transportation, or shared rides that pool the assets and make sure that they\u2019re moving all the time. So if cars moved all the time, we wouldn\u2019t need as many of them. But you also then need to solve the problem of how do I keep them moving, which means you have to charge them if they\u2019re EVs. And EVs have the problem that it takes four hours to charge them. That\u2019s downtime, you have to charge them fast. One of the reasons why NIO prioritizes battery swapping is it eliminates the problem of four hours of recharge. And that\u2019s I think that\u2019d be very popular here in China. It wouldn\u2019t have happened outside of China. It wanted to happen before, and there was even an Israeli startup that became a unicorn that tried to be a battery swapping company. But the automotive industry then 10 years ago wasn\u2019t ready for that technology. But in China where we have a completely different context of how people move, it is very much a benefit to have the ability to fast charge your car. The logistics industry is the driver for autonomous vehicles The other issue is self-driving technology. And I think that\u2019s where I think China really stands out to be the lead market for self-driving vehicles. First of all, I don\u2019t think the motivation to get behind the wheel and drive is as high here. Some people want to own a car for sure. But they don\u2019t want to drive it every day. They want to have it when they need it for occasional use. But manually actuating a vehicle is not the ambition. It\u2019s the ownership and the pride of ownership, not necessarily get me out in the traffic jam so that I can experience gridlock. I grew up in New York, I never really was motivated to go to Manhattan with my car. But if I needed to go out to the countryside, no problem, I\u2019ll take the car for that. So I think in China the use cases for mobility are going to determine what the type of solution is, but self driving is commercialized in a completely different way. And it\u2019s going to be mainly driven by the logistics economy, it\u2019s going to be mainly driven by e-commerce, by the food delivery, the robo delivery. Use case will be the commercial driver for the self-driving vehicle because I think when you talk about people movement, the hurdles are higher, you\u2019ve got occupant safety risk, the issue of responsibility for the safety of the occupant, there are going to be more regulations there. But I think for delivery applications, and for goods movement applications, they absolutely will be commercialized faster in China.

What technology does is it disrupts and finds ways to make things more efficient. Internet abhors inefficiency, and internet companies seek to disrupt inefficient business models, whether that\u2019s publishing, or music, or just pick a thing that required a physical product to be manufactured and sold in a retail way. The internet took out the inefficiency. If I had to physically print a book, sell it through a distributor to a book retailer, and then have you go to the bookstore, which we like to do. I certainly like to browse through physical books and I still do. But all of that inefficiency of the physical print, the factory to do that, the handling and intermediaries in between who each took a little bit more profit, at the end of the day, something that should cost a few dollars ends up costing $30 to buy a hardcover book from a bookstore. Amazon threw that business model away and said I\u2019m going to sell books online. I could do that with no physical factory to build the book, no distribution channel, just put the information online and you just download it and consume it through Amazon Kindle. But the bookstore still exists and there\u2019s still people still want to go have coffee. The bookstores became coffee shops, we like to hang out to see people and sometimes you want to touch it physically the leaf pages. I still liked reading the flaps. Some people even young people might still do it that way. But it\u2019s gonna get challenged by the new. That\u2019s where we are with the automotive industry. What we are pointing out is the inefficiency. The inefficiency was there all along. It was the 5% utilized car. If the way we become personally mobile, not public transport, but personally mobile, to get in our own personalized mobility experience, we had to physically buy a device, a bicycle, a car, we had to free ourselves up from the bus and the train, by physically buying hardware. The internet said no, I can give you that. Even if you\u2019re a taxi hailing person, you don\u2019t have to stand in the border and get elbowed out by somebody else who jumps in front of you and grabs that taxi. You just tell the app and that\u2019s your ride. There\u2019s no more competition on the street. When I lived in Beijing on Changanjie, and I had to position myself in a way where I was able to not get on the taxi line, because you\u2019re going to have 15 people waiting at the taxi stand in front of you. So you end up standing maybe 20\u201330 meters in front of the taxi line and try to grab the taxi before everybody else. This is China, we\u2019re all competing for space and there\u2019s no such thing as Pai Dui (waiting in line); wherever there\u2019s Pai Dui, there\u2019s a Jia San (cutting in line) and there\u2019s somebody who will come in and say \u201cokay, I\u2019m gonna grab that spot\u201d, whether it\u2019s waiting for a taxi or Uber, or applying for college or anything else that you might do, there\u2019s always five other people that want to do it in front of you. [ chuckles ] The Internet sees the inefficiency and says I can serve and give you a more personalized experience, and you don\u2019t have to stand in line anymore. You might have to outbid someone online but that\u2019s the profit of the internet company. So it sees that and recognizes mobility as a service. Tech companies think differently I had the experience of meeting Cheng Wei [4] . And I brought a car company to meet him in 2015. It was the CEO of Ford China that went to Beijing with me. After they shook hands, he (Cheng Wei) said, it\u2019s great to meet a famous company like Ford, we are in the same business. And the Ford CEO said: \u201creally? We\u2019re a manufacturing company and you\u2019re an app. How are we in the same business?\u201d Cheng Wei said: \u201cWell, Henry Ford democratized mobility with mass production, and we\u2019re democratizing mobility with an app. \u201d Figure 6: DIDI\u2019s founder and CEO, Cheng Wei And I thought, wow, that defines what the internet\u2019s doing. This is the automotive industry, I\u2019m not in the business of the utility, I\u2019m in the business of the product. I\u2019m making a mobility device but I\u2019m not profiting from its movement. So the internet economy sees the inefficiency and says, I\u2019m going to blow that away. I don\u2019t need a factory. You can be the factory for me. Like Ford, you can build a car, and I tell you what a person who I put in the car might want to do when they\u2019re in it and build me that car. Or maybe we can help the cars that are in service use your dealership network or some type of service network. So you have to come at the problem thinking differently. And that\u2019s what the internet companies are doing. When you look at NIO, when you look at at Apple, when you look at Waymo, they\u2019re solving a different problem. First question you have to ask is why are these companies experimenting mobility? What did they want? And the answer most people give, which is the wrong answer, is maybe they want to become car companies. No, I don\u2019t think so. Who wants to be a manufacturing company? They want they see what human beings do every day. And they say, how can I make that better? From problems to tech-enabled solution What Didi did is they see what human beings do everyday, they move around every day, they don\u2019t necessarily like to go on the train, they don\u2019t necessarily want to go on a bus, they don\u2019t like standing in a taxi queue, and I have a technology solution for that. So if you\u2019re Apple, or if you\u2019re Waymo and you say, I\u2019m in the business of monetizing online services. If you are Google, what do people do every day? They move around. How do I capture that user as part of my Android operating system? I\u2019m Apple. What do people do every day? They listen to music, they make phone calls, they they take pictures, and they move around. So mobility is always on the list of what we do every day: we order food, there\u2019s Alibaba; we cook, there\u2019s Hema [5] . The internect company sees what we do every day, and it monetizes us with a service that makes it easier for us to do that. And if there\u2019s an inefficiency in the business of delivering that service to us, they attack it. What\u2019s the inefficiency in transportation today? Fuel cost, maintenance cost and driver cost. How do you mitigate that? Electric and autonomous vehicles. So you get quickly to the answer if you think in the in the digital context. Self-driving technology, connectivity, and operating systems The first wave of disruption of the automotive industry was mobility as a service; the second wave of disruption is electric and connected vehicle technology. We\u2019re in that era right now. We\u2019re in the advent of electrification and early stages of self-driving technology. It\u2019s called ADAS \u2014 Advanced Driver Assistance System. China likes to call it ICV \u2014 Intelligent Connected Vehicle. Same thing but different names. But it brings the idea of connectivity into the equation. And when you bring connectivity into the equation, you bring the operating systems into play. IOS, Android, Harmony OS, that\u2019s why Huawei is in the game; Duer OS, that\u2019s why Baidu is in the game; Ali OS, that\u2019s why Alibaba is in the game; MIUI, that\u2019s why Lei Jun [6] is in the game. Pick a device, and then say is the automobile a device? What operating system should power it? Mine, if you\u2019re an internet company. So it\u2019s only a matter of time until all of the tech companies are in some level in the future of mobility. The car is the most sophisticated computer that we will interact with on a day to day basis. Who wants to be the operating system that powers the apps that are presenting the applications to the users in the everyday computer that they\u2019re being transported in? The answer is every single tech company . [ chuckles ] Figure 7: NIO OS and its center console","title":"Mr. Russo"},{"location":"articles/AMA/TheFutureofMobility/#prof-luyao-zhang_1","text":"This sounds interesting, because we were doing research about the decentralized finance application on the blockchain. But you help me see another user case: a car is also like a platform.","title":"Prof. Luyao Zhang"},{"location":"articles/AMA/TheFutureofMobility/#mr-russo_4","text":"Not only is it a smart device, it\u2019s probably one of the most personalized and immersive spaces outside of our living room. It\u2019s probably going to be the most personalizable space. Even our workplaces is less personalized, because we share it with with others. But when we\u2019re in that vehicle, that\u2019s our box, that\u2019s our cave. And it doesn\u2019t have to be ours for the time that we\u2019re in it. The technology is sophisticated enough to know who we are with facial recognition, you just have to sit in it for the device to know who you are. What\u2019s the difference between shared mobility and personal mobility? The difference is there\u2019s somebody driving a car where I have never met before. The other thing is, I\u2019m never going to remember this car 10 minutes after I get out of it because they didn\u2019t personalize. But you will remember it when it\u2019s personalized. That\u2019s what the internet knows how to do. They know how to make the services sticky. The successful internet companies are the ones that you miss when you don\u2019t have it. The reason why people buy a device is because of the operating system and because they know their cloud storage, their photos and music, whatever they prefer, whether it\u2019s harmony OS or IOS. You will be making a decision of what car to get on the basis of what operating system it has. I posted something online on LinkedIn about BYD. Somebody said I would want a BYD, but it doesn\u2019t have Harmony OS. I\u2019ve been saying this a long time, people will make a decision of what car to either own or use based on what experience they\u2019re going to have in it, and the operating system is what defines the personalized experience of mobility. Transportation device as an experience","title":"Mr. Russo"},{"location":"articles/AMA/TheFutureofMobility/#prof-luyao-zhang_2","text":"I feel like it\u2019s similar to the thing you mentioned about parking lot. Because right now we are taking Didi for the convenience of doing something else, but the process is actually redundant. What if the process of transportation is also itself a valuable experience?","title":"Prof. Luyao Zhang"},{"location":"articles/AMA/TheFutureofMobility/#mr-russo_5","text":"Think about your hospitality industry. If we\u2019re in business traveling, you book a hotel because it\u2019s in the city that you\u2019re going to. It just happens to be convenient for you to be going to that particular place. But there were destination hotels, you go there because of what it is. It is something very popular here in China, people go on weekend trips in their home city. It\u2019s become very popular even now during COVID because of the travel restrictions. I don\u2019t want to be in my home all the time. I\u2019ll go book a weekend in Chongming [7] . I went out to Thousand Island with my daughter and we never really left. There\u2019s this beautiful lake there. We went outside once and we spent the rest of time in the hotel, because there\u2019s a children\u2019s play area and there\u2019s a lady making syrupy angels. [ chuckles ] There was so much to do she never left. And till this day my daughter was three years old and she was two years old when we went. She still calls it daddy\u2019s hotel. The funny thing is we may think of mobility that way, not too far in the future, where you can create an experience and make that the reason you got in it. You just need another space. Community / Brand culture is the game-changer I think there\u2019s a seed of that in the NIO\u2019s business design. A lot of people buying NIO are not buying just because of the car. It\u2019s an EV, but it\u2019s also a community. William Li [8] did something with NIO day. I went to one of them, the one that they had here in Shanghai with Bruno Mars. It was a cult. It was like we were all NIO enthusiasts. And then he builds this NIO house, which is basically a club. So when you\u2019re thinking do I buy a Tesla or a NIO, and you\u2019re Chinese, and you\u2019re thinking, \u201cthat one\u2019s got a more famous multinational brand, but this one has people I can meet, I can socialize with, I get invited to go see Bruno Mars or whomever\u201d. So you\u2019ve created a community. You\u2019ve created a culture. We did that a little bit at Chrysler with Jeep, the Camp Jeep where if you own a Jeep, you can go and take it out in the off road experience. Thousands of people every year would go to Camp Jeep. I think there\u2019s a bit of that in the DNA of the internet company, because it\u2019s social communities and it\u2019s online attachment. If I can build that feature around my mobility experience, then I have a reason to stay with the brand. It\u2019s no longer just having a physical device but there are things that the physical device enables in my lifestyle that I can let go of. That\u2019s the part that I think the digital economy will invent a way for people to remember the mobility experience more than they remember the hardware itself. They need to attach it somehow to the hardware, and they need to make the experience so unique, where I can\u2019t not have that . Apple enthusiasts sometimes are called Apple fanboys, that they\u2019re so devoted to the brand where they have to have all the latest and greatest stuff, and they are constantly looking for upgrades. Or you\u2019ll even go to the store not intending to buy anything, but rather just enjoy going to the store. You\u2019re sucked into this community of people that like to brag about all the cool technology. And I think that\u2019s where you\u2019re going to see this industry evolve is these smart device companies, who, by the way, have stores. For traditional cars, you\u2019d never go to the dealership. The most horrible experience about ownership is buying the car and getting it serviced. So the dealership is not a fun place to go. It\u2019s like going to the dentist. [ chuckles ] You are like: do I really have to do this? I got to get my teeth cleaned every now and then but do I really get excited about the idea of going there? No. That\u2019s the car dealership to the car owner. However, that\u2019s not the Tesla store. That\u2019s not the NIO store. It\u2019s like people just want to go in there because it looks like: hey, people are having some fun and cool stuff in there. If you go over here on Corporate Avenue five, go to the HiFi store. I put my little girl in there and it\u2019s got this wacky vehicle design. It\u2019s got these goldwing kind of doors that fly up. But when you get in the car, it\u2019s got this, and this is what the Chinese brands I think are very different than the foreign companies is they got these gigantic screens in front of you. And I put my three-year-old daughter in the passenger seat and she knew how to tap, swipe, and find what she wanted. She found Paw Patrol and it was just lots of watching. I can\u2019t get her out of the car. It\u2019s like she knows how to do this. I put her in a Tesla. She got behind the wheel. And within two seconds she\u2019s tapping and she\u2019s learning how to turn the radio on. I didn\u2019t tell her to do any of this stuff. I put her in the NIO car. If you want to see how the future is going to be like, take a little child and put them in a car and look at what they do. They go right for the screen. The other thing NIO did is they put a little robot sitting there called Nomi, which you can talk to. And when you ask it to play music, not only does it blink and smile at you, a little guitar comes out. It\u2019s got a little animation of the guitar playing while the music is playing. I got her out of the car and I went to another shopping mall and it was a Ford. I\u2019m not downplaying Ford but I put her in the Ford. She didn\u2019t want to stay in the car. There was no screen. And she asked me where\u2019s Nomi? Where\u2019s the little face? Where\u2019s my little robot that I can talk to? And I\u2019m thinking the traditional car companies are not in sync with where this world is going. Figure 8: NOMI-NIO\u2019s cute in-car AI assistant Customer segmentation leads to multi-brand strategy I was invited to Ningbo by Geely to experience their new car, Zeeker. They put me into the new Zeeker car. Also, mind-blowing performance and giant screen. You can have a comfortable ride, you can have a performance ride, you can change the driving experience. That\u2019s a neat idea. It also had a giant screen. So I asked him first of all, why do you have so many brands. He said in China, there\u2019s so many different segments in the market so you need to be able to speak to the customers in a more granular level. Having one brand to cover everything is not appropriate. That\u2019s counterintuitive logic to the way the multinational car companies have thought. They approached multi-brand strategy in a different way. They saw it as a way of standardizing on the manufacturing line with a common set of technologies and then creating prices and life stage brands with different levels of content for different lifestyles. So if you\u2019re GM, you start with a Chevrolet and then maybe you graduate to a Pontiac, a Buick, Oldsmobile, and a Cadillac. Basically, it\u2019s the same car. It just had different top hat and different interior. You might have leather, you might have something else. You had something that differentiated it, but everything under the covers was the same. The chassis was the same. Even today you see a Toyota has Lexus, but the Lexus cars are basically the same as Toyota cars but just with more leather in it. In China, these brands are targeting totally different customers. The GreatWall brand has TANK, they even have a pickup truck brand. Now they have HAVAL, they have WEY and they have ORA [9] . And the ORA brand is totally targeted at young, 20 to 35 years old buyers. EV in China is going to be sold to the younger technology savvy population. The way it\u2019s being done elsewhere is through price premium. You can get a Volkswagen, or you can get a Volkswagen electric. The latter is going to cost more. You got the world upside down here. If you price it higher, you\u2019re not going to appeal to the younger buyer. You\u2019re trying to sell it to the older buyer because they have more money. You don\u2019t want to be that cheap ( referring to the previous Wuling EV that\u2019s priced at RMB 30k ). That\u2019s too democratized. You want to make money at it. But take the Geely approach. Let\u2019s create a brand. Let\u2019s call it something that you\u2019ll notice. What is a Zeeker? So I asked them what Zeeker is. \u201cZ\u201d for Generation Z, \u201ceek\u201d is geek, what\u2019s the Generation Z geek? It\u2019s a Zeeker. So they\u2019re basically saying to you, \u201cI\u2019m selling EVs to the younger population\u201d, which is exactly the way you should be doing it. Because the younger people are going to be more tech savvy. They\u2019re going to not want to have what their mom and pop had, if their mom and pop even owned a car. If they didn\u2019t own a car, they\u2019re definitely going to want to have an EV. Anybody who\u2019s probably born in this century is probably far less likely to buy a combustion engine powered vehicle than an EV. So let\u2019s name a brand after them.","title":"Mr. Russo"},{"location":"articles/AMA/TheFutureofMobility/#question-4","text":"","title":"Question 4"},{"location":"articles/AMA/TheFutureofMobility/#lewis_3","text":"With the rapidly changing and diversifying landscape of the automobile industry, how do you think talents and scholars should prepare to make an impact in the industry?","title":"Lewis"},{"location":"articles/AMA/TheFutureofMobility/#mr-russo_6","text":"The connectivity between industry and academic institutions I was talking to somebody recently, whose son is about to go to university. And he was having a debate with his son over what to major in. His son wants to be in the automotive industry. And he couldn\u2019t convince the son to not major in mechanical engineering. He is saying the higher priced graduates are the ones who have the skills needed for the electronics, the software, and the self driving technology. He is an investor so he kind of knows where the money\u2019s going. It\u2019s not in mechanical engineering. It is a dilemma for the automotive industry, because the automotive industry tends to be served by the universities that surround it. In the automotive centers of the world, the technical universities in Germany, even in the US, University of Michigan, Michigan State University, Ohio State University, those universities have a strong mechanical engineering, deeply rooted academic bias. There\u2019s a reason why Stanford and MIT, which are long standing academic institutions, but they\u2019re not in the backyard of an industry that is deeply rooted in a particular discipline. And you\u2019ve got the other added benefit of new tech. The venture capital world surrounds the academic institutions that breed the kinds of technologies that are needed in the future, because the venture world is about the future. It\u2019s not about preserving the past. So this is the dilemma that the automotive industry faces. The institutions that support it, which include academia are geared to the old legacy, not to the next generation. And it lacks in many of those locations, the vibrancy of a deep pocketed venture capital, risk hungry venture capital world. The automotive industry\u2019s business model is rooted in a risk-averse financial system. Taking on risk is the purpose of venture capital, it\u2019s to absorb the risk. It\u2019s to say, \u201cI accept the fact that 9 out of 10 are going to fail\u201d, because it\u2019s the 10th one that\u2019s going to make back all the money. And that\u2019s what Stanford represents, that\u2019s what MIT represents as a breeding ground for the next generation of tech. I would argue that Carnegie Mellon. There\u2019s a bastion of hope in the upper Midwest, and that the AV (autonomous vehicles) tech, the Pittsburgh Cleveland corridor did find some backing with the autonomous vehicle development coming out of their academic institutions. But the academic institutions have to see beyond the incumbent companies to the next generation of technology startups, and gravitate to orbiting these very small dust clouds, which eventually will be the the burning stars of the future of mobility. Figure 9: Stanford\u2019s autonomous vehicle That\u2019s why Tesla is in California, and that\u2019s why California is such a hotbed for talent. That\u2019s why even the Chinese EV companies need to go to California. It\u2019s because you\u2019ve got the AV talent coming from there. You\u2019ve got the Googles of the world, the Apples of the world that are the next generation of mobility disruption companies. You\u2019ve got all the AV tech companies that test their vehicles in that area. You need to spot the trend and reform the academics. I don\u2019t want to say all academia is this way, but they tend to gravitate to where they get funded. And sometimes they get funded by old institutions that are not trying to reform the industries that they serve.","title":"Mr. Russo"},{"location":"articles/AMA/TheFutureofMobility/#prof-luyao-zhang_3","text":"Yeah, I really feel this.

If I\u2019m in Wolfsburg [10] I\u2019m really panicking right now, because this is their biggest market. I\u2019m sure Tongji university with Volkswagens backing is doing a lot of cool R&D. But how much of that is finally going to find its way to commercial scale if they can\u2019t figure out how to climb the hill in China. They\u2019ll be able to do that in Europe, because buyers of Volkswagen products in Europe are not going to think anything different about Volkswagen as an EV company. They\u2019ll say, \u201cokay I\u2019m fine with that\u201d. But this is China. I think Chinese, you\u2019re gonna have a different buyer of EV than traditional cars. And the people buying EVs are shopping TESLA, they\u2019re shopping the new stuff. Then if they\u2019re not happy with that they might go back and look at Volkswagen and look at their EV. But I don\u2019t think so. I think they\u2019re totally different buyers. Volkswagen might sell that EV to somebody in their 50s who can afford it, who might be a little bit more tech savvy than somebody else in his age demographic. But the 35 year old, 30 year old or the 25 year old, they\u2019re looking to NIO, they\u2019re looking at XPENG, they\u2019re looking at the Chinese brands, Entrepreneurship in Israel I look at Israel, which is a small market that has to be global in the way they think. And they do a very good job at the academic institution level of incubating new startups. And then they create support structures for the startups in their early stage like incubators. But they are also backed by local venture investments that can bring these young plants to a level where they can be, at some point, competitive in the forest. You need that kind of system, and the university shouldn be the incubators. It\u2019s not because they\u2019re demographically young. You\u2019ll find 50, 60 years old entrepreneurs, they\u2019ve just done this their whole life. They\u2019ve started several different companies. And that makes them even more valuable, because they know how to get funded, how to work through the system, they know how to sell the company to a company that can help them scale. So they\u2019re really good at it. And I think it\u2019s that startup and venture backed ecosystem, with the universities as a breeding ground. There has to be some form to do that.","title":"Mr. Russo"},{"location":"articles/AMA/TheFutureofMobility/#prof-luyao-zhang_4","text":"All my advisors are Jewish, so I\u2019m familiar with the community.

That\u2019s the problem, not as much in the US but definitely in Europe. The academic institutions are geared to the traditional industries.

Questions 1 Xinyu: In both of your articles Tokenomics: Dynamic Adoption and Valuation and Token-based Platform Finance , you are talking about building a novel tokenomics model. Could you please briefly introduce your incentives in the field of blockchain and cryptocurrency? Prof. Li: When we start this project, we\u2019re also newcomers to this field, and what we really want to do is to write down mathematical models that can help us to understand what a token-based ecosystem is . Because once you write down these models and formalize these concepts, like the idea of user-base, the quality of the platform, and how to specify the dynamics of token price\u2026 Once you start to formalize things and write them in a mathematical form, you can start to understand better. In the process of searching for the model that fits the reality the best, we have to read a lot of materials and try to capture the first-order issues that most practitioners and regulators pay attention to in the field of cryptocurrency or the economics of token which we call tokenomics. One thing that we consider the most important is the concept that a token, especially a narrowly defined utility token, is really the native currency of a digital platform. Figure 2: Digital Platform Think about a digital platform as a country. If your country is running very well with a lot of economic activities, what you tend to observe is that your country\u2019s currency will appreciate in the foreign exchange market. That\u2019s typically how we relate economic fundamentals to the fluctuation of the price of a country\u2019s currency. However, how do you build the analogy between a country and a platform? Just think of it as a place where people meet each other and conduct transactions . Figure 4: Transactions People interact with each other and transactions take place in a country, but digital platforms, like Taobao or Tmall, they\u2019re also where people conduct transactions. Basically, if you have a platform where a lot of economic activities taking place and you have a native currency that is required in the means of payment for people to settle transactions, then you have a natural positive correlation between the number of economic activities taking place on the platform and the value of your cryptocurrency. This is the first step. By recognizing that you can run your platform as a country, you can introduce your own currency and the value of your currency will reflect the economic activities and how popular your platform is. In step two, what we think about is why the introduction of platform-specific currencies happened recently: we have digital platforms all the time, we have had Alibaba in China for more than 20 years and we have Amazon in the United States for almost the same period of time, but they never introduce the cryptocurrency. Why do these new platforms start to introduce cryptocurrencies recently? Let me just give you an example. This is one of my favorite cryptocurrencies especially when we come to utility tokens, it is called the basic attention token. What a basic attention token does is that it provides a platform for people to buy or sell attention, which sounds very abstract but actually very interesting and concrete. If you are an advertiser, you buy advertising spaces by paying the Basic Attention Token (BAT) . Figure 5: Basic Attention Token But where are these advertising spaces and where are the advertisements being posted? They are posted on the BAT web browser which is just like Google Chrome or Internet Explorer. If you want to post advertisements on their browser, you buy BAT. That\u2019s the demand for BAT. But where is the supply? BAT will increase the supply by issuing new tokens to reward the browser user . If you use the browser, spending time reading one advertisement, depending on the allocation of the attention you receive new tokens which are the newly issued BAT. That\u2019s how the supply increases. The supply of BAT increases to reward the browser users who pay attention. The demand for BAT increases when there are people who want to do advertisements. They sell dollars to buy BAT so that they can use BAT to pay for advertisement spaces. But when will the BAT price appreciates? When you see the advertisers keep coming into this particular platform to buy attention since it\u2019s a very good and productive platform with a lot of web browser users, the demand for it increases and that\u2019s when the price of BAT increases. So the second driver in tokenomics is that to introduce token or native currency on a digital platform is to let early comers know that they can be rewarded with cryptocurrency since they come early and they can expect that the cryptocurrency will appreciate in the value in the future if the platform is indeed a good platform and will grow in popularity with more and more people joining in, making the demand for this cryptocurrency stronger. That\u2019s the same logic if we go back to the analogy with our country. If you think this country is very promising and will grow in terms of economy and become more and more powerful, you will expect its currency to appreciate. The Chinese currency has been strengthening in the last decades. When I was a kid, the exchange rate between the US dollar and RMB was eight to one; For now, it is around 6.2 to 6.5 depending on which period of time. This secular appreciation of the Chinese currency is directly linked to the very stable circular growth of the Chinese economy. Going back to the platform. If the platform is expected to grow in popularity and the number of economic activities it supports, the early comers who receive these tokens in the beginning, expect appreciation. If you are thinking about whether to join the platform, you will want to join early if you think it is indeed a good platform and you want to hold cryptocurrency and enjoy the potential appreciation in the future. So the first step is to conceptually link the platforms\u2019 economic activity to the value of the cryptocurrency; And the second conceptual link is that by introducing a native currency on the platform, you basically front-load the expected growth of the platform into the expected appreciation of the platform\u2019s native currency so that early comers want to join, to hold the cryptocurrency as assets, and become part of the community. The reason why a digital platform wants to introduce cryptocurrency is precise to stimulate early adoption. Now it comes to the third step which is very critical for a platform developer: how can you persuade the potential users that your network is really good and going to be better in the future? It depends on the communication. That\u2019s why you really need to write a very informative White Paper to know how this platform will grow to give people confidence and then you can stimulate early adoption and you need to make it very clear the tokenomics. Remember that we talked about the example of basic attention tokens, you need to tell people where the supply and demand come from. If you increase the demand the price of the crypto will increase, this means deflation, which refers to money becoming more valuable. Deflation pressure comes from the expanding demand and the inflationary pressure that makes the currency less valuable and it comes from the increasing supply. When you increase supply, you better use it for good purposes like rewarding early adopters and contributors who either contribute in developing software for this particular platform or miners who maintain the ledger, making sure that all the transactions on the platform are recorded correctly, which is also a kind of contribution to the infrastructure. So when you issue more tokens you better make sure that these tokens are being rewarded to the most productive people or people contributing to the community. When the demand and the supply increase at the same time, that\u2019s when you observe the price being stable; Even the demand can increase faster than the supply, then you can expect the price to increase over time and that is what we want. Basically, for platform developers, it is necessary to do these communications carefully, telling people where the growth trajectory lies and make the tokenomics very clear, including the supply and demand of tokens, why and when they happen, and the mechanism. So, the basic idea is that, if you have a country with economic activities, the currency tends to appreciate; While the same thing can be applied to a platform. Questions 2 Xinyu: Thank you so much for sharing your interest in cryptocurrency and digital platform governance and also the three-step incentives and we\u2019ve got a better understanding of how cryptocurrency helps to govern and stimulate the platform and users. The second question is also related to the token economy. We know you\u2019re doing research on cryptocurrency and focus on platform tokens. And the token economy has significant practical impacts on all stakeholders. So how do you think the token economy will reshape the way scholars do research in finance and collaborate with practitioners? Prof. Li: Very good question. I am still struggling to try to find the answer myself, so let me just share with you some preliminary thoughts. Finance as a field evolved out of macroeconomics. In the United States, the premier institution is called National Bureau of Economic Research or NBER in short. Before the 1980s, there was no asset pricing or corporate finance groups in the NBER; asset pricing means capital markets and corporate finance means corporate decisions regarding investment, financing, governance, etc. The asset pricing and corporate finance groups evolved out of the monetary economics group in the NBER. The new area of the cryptocurrency really encourages researchers to go back to the root and find the connection between macroeconomics and finance and really go back to the previous generations, what James Tobin and Milton Friedman thought about. When these people think about monetary economics, finance is always there. Then, this field bifurcated: \u201cmacro-people\u201d do \u201cmacro\u201d and \u201cfinance-people\u201d do \u201cfinance\u201d. Figure 6: Finance & Economics Now we need them to come together, that\u2019s how we can understand digital currency or cryptocurrency because almost every currency is embedded on platforms where people transact. Different platforms support different economic activities like a country as I mentioned before. So just by connecting with the old literature or maybe the new literature of monetary economics, it can really help us understand and both the corporate finance aspect of cryptocurrency and the asset pricing aspect. So that\u2019s the first thing I want to talk about. Really going back to the root, bring money and finance together. This is also what Markus Brunnermeier , a Professor at Princeton University Economics Department, is trying to advertise. If you have a chance, go to his website, he has a lot of good stuff on both monetary economics and cryptocurrency. I myself come from a macro-finance background; I do research in corporate finance now but more from a macroeconomic point of view. The second thing I want to say which is also very important is to combine computer science and finance. Because right now we still have this segmentation, which is that people in CS do a lot of interesting research in many cases based on game theory, they do research on cryptocurrency, and finance people do their own thing. There should be more communication between these two fields, which I think Professor Zhang has been very active in building this bridge, and I can see a lot of activities in your university which are very encouraging and promising. Why? Computer scientists, although they know the game theory, when it comes to dynamic systems or dynamic interaction of many agents, still have a lot to learn from finance, economics, and monetary economics in particular. And there are issues in monetary economics that people have thought about for three or four hundred years, maybe even earlier than Adam Smith [1]; So people think about money as a subject for hundreds of years. Now we have computer scientists coming and want to do something and reinvent the wheel. There\u2019s no such necessity; read economics literature and then you will find a lot of things already very clear. On the other hand, the finance people think about will all these economics, mechanisms, all these incentives on the economic participants also hold in a token-based environment. But what about the fundamental issue? How are these infrastructures being built? Because in many cases, the working of the infrastructure itself, which depends on a lot of knowledge of computer science, is very intertwined with the supply and demand of the tokens. And that\u2019s why I say a lot of work from the interaction between computer science and finance can be very promising in this area. The last point I want to make is that you have to talk to the practitioners . You cannot just stay in the ivory tower. You have to talk with practitioners like what you guys do here and when we talk to the practitioners, we can recalibrate our thinking process. For instance, in the paper Tokenomics: Dynamic Adoption and Valuation , when I write down the valuation formula, I think it\u2019s reasonable because a lot of practitioners emphasize that when you value the cryptocurrency, you have to value it with respect to the user base. It is like when you value a bank you value the market cap with respect to the book value of equity. And if you look at people on Wall Street nowadays who do a lot of interesting research like Thomas Lee in Fundstrat, they all emphasize the same thing \u2014 the total cap of the cryptocurrency should be linked to the total number of active users \u2014 this goes back to the idea that the currency of a country or digital platform is more valuable when there are more economic activities proxied by the number of users. Questions 3 Zesen: Thank you for sharing three points about how cryptocurrency and platform tokens promote collaboration between scholars and cooperative firms and how computer science can be interdisciplinary for monetary economics and collaboration between academia and industry which definitely support a real usage of the new technology. I think this one would be the last question for this interview which is related to Dfinity\u2019s Internet Computer. The Internet Computer, IC, in short, is the first frictionless blockchain with web speed and the Internet-scale throughout the world. It extends the functionality of the public Internet so that it can be hosting software, transforming it into a global computing platform. So do you think Internet Computer or any other decentralized technology can solve the blockchain trilemma, which isdecentralization, scalability, and security? And how do you think the Internet Computer can possibly empower the financial industry and your research in this area? Prof. Li: Since we don\u2019t have a lot of time left, I\u2019ll just cut my answer short. The short answer is yes, and I think it is a very promising project. I think it is a very good idea of web 3.0 based on decentralized computing. Going back to what we talked about before, the theme of our conversation today is that if you want a cryptocurrency to succeed, you better build a good platform that can support a variety of economic activities, because the more economic activities, the better the cryptocurrency performs. So, to my knowledge, Dfinity has its own cryptocurrency with very sophisticated tokenomics, especially the deflationary force is directly linked to what people can do on this platform. And people can do a lot of things if you enable decentralized computing. The predecessor of decentralized computing is edge computing. Figure 8: Edge Computing We all have mobile devices and we can do computation on mobile devices, we can enable some remote computers to access our mobile devices and do computation there. So decentralized computing can certainly enable a lot of things. So I think it is a very promising project because it can enable a lot of blockchain-based activities. Another thing I want to mention is scalability. So I have first to admit that I am not an expert on Dfinity itself so I just try to read as much as I can. But to my knowledge, it is quite a scalable network. Because the more people join the platform, the more computational power the platform will have. If we have more computational power, the throughput of the payment system can be increased. This is quite different from Bitcoin. I am not going to comment on Ethereum since I am still trying to learn Ethereum 2.0 and the transition from proof of work to proof of stake \u2014 but to my knowledge, Bitcoin has very limited throughput because of the particular design of tokenomics. When more people want to transact, they just over-bid each other in terms of the transaction fees. But when the transaction fees go up, this would invite more and more miners since they want to mine the Bitcoin and earn the transaction fee. But when more miners come onto the network, it is more difficult to reach a decentralized consensus among the increasing number of miners. There is a dilemma of bitcoin adoption scalability and I recommend a paper from Fahad from Wake Forest University and Kose John and Franz J. Hinzen from New York University, they have a great paper on the limited adoption of Bitcoin exactly about this point. But to my understanding, Dfinity is not subject to this problem, so that\u2019s why I am particularly optimistic on the scalability side. In terms of security, I don\u2019t have a lot to say about this because I am not an expert in cyber security. But I know they do have a lot of great scientists working on this, so let\u2019s see. I think in the future, we\u2019re going to see a lot of news coming from this project and I am looking forward to their achievements. Xinyu: Thank you so much, this is all for the interview. Prof. Li: Thank you for inviting me and I look forward to your other interviews and all your publications. It is very impressive work that you\u2019re doing.

When the demand and the supply increase at the same time, that\u2019s when you observe the price being stable; Even the demand can increase faster than the supply, then you can expect the price to increase over time and that is what we want. Basically, for platform developers, it is necessary to do these communications carefully, telling people where the growth trajectory lies and make the tokenomics very clear, including the supply and demand of tokens, why and when they happen, and the mechanism. So, the basic idea is that, if you have a country with economic activities, the currency tends to appreciate; While the same thing can be applied to a platform.","title":"Questions 1"},{"location":"articles/AMA/Tokeneconomics%3AWhenMacroandMicroEconomicsUniteinFinance/#questions-2","text":"Xinyu: Thank you so much for sharing your interest in cryptocurrency and digital platform governance and also the three-step incentives and we\u2019ve got a better understanding of how cryptocurrency helps to govern and stimulate the platform and users. The second question is also related to the token economy. We know you\u2019re doing research on cryptocurrency and focus on platform tokens. And the token economy has significant practical impacts on all stakeholders. So how do you think the token economy will reshape the way scholars do research in finance and collaborate with practitioners? Prof. Li: Very good question. I am still struggling to try to find the answer myself, so let me just share with you some preliminary thoughts. Finance as a field evolved out of macroeconomics. In the United States, the premier institution is called National Bureau of Economic Research or NBER in short. Before the 1980s, there was no asset pricing or corporate finance groups in the NBER; asset pricing means capital markets and corporate finance means corporate decisions regarding investment, financing, governance, etc. The asset pricing and corporate finance groups evolved out of the monetary economics group in the NBER. The new area of the cryptocurrency really encourages researchers to go back to the root and find the connection between macroeconomics and finance and really go back to the previous generations, what James Tobin and Milton Friedman thought about. When these people think about monetary economics, finance is always there. Then, this field bifurcated: \u201cmacro-people\u201d do \u201cmacro\u201d and \u201cfinance-people\u201d do \u201cfinance\u201d. Figure 6: Finance & Economics Now we need them to come together, that\u2019s how we can understand digital currency or cryptocurrency because almost every currency is embedded on platforms where people transact. Different platforms support different economic activities like a country as I mentioned before. So just by connecting with the old literature or maybe the new literature of monetary economics, it can really help us understand and both the corporate finance aspect of cryptocurrency and the asset pricing aspect. So that\u2019s the first thing I want to talk about. Really going back to the root, bring money and finance together. This is also what Markus Brunnermeier , a Professor at Princeton University Economics Department, is trying to advertise. If you have a chance, go to his website, he has a lot of good stuff on both monetary economics and cryptocurrency. I myself come from a macro-finance background; I do research in corporate finance now but more from a macroeconomic point of view. The second thing I want to say which is also very important is to combine computer science and finance. Because right now we still have this segmentation, which is that people in CS do a lot of interesting research in many cases based on game theory, they do research on cryptocurrency, and finance people do their own thing. There should be more communication between these two fields, which I think Professor Zhang has been very active in building this bridge, and I can see a lot of activities in your university which are very encouraging and promising. Why? Computer scientists, although they know the game theory, when it comes to dynamic systems or dynamic interaction of many agents, still have a lot to learn from finance, economics, and monetary economics in particular. And there are issues in monetary economics that people have thought about for three or four hundred years, maybe even earlier than Adam Smith [1]; So people think about money as a subject for hundreds of years. Now we have computer scientists coming and want to do something and reinvent the wheel. There\u2019s no such necessity; read economics literature and then you will find a lot of things already very clear. On the other hand, the finance people think about will all these economics, mechanisms, all these incentives on the economic participants also hold in a token-based environment. But what about the fundamental issue? How are these infrastructures being built? Because in many cases, the working of the infrastructure itself, which depends on a lot of knowledge of computer science, is very intertwined with the supply and demand of the tokens. And that\u2019s why I say a lot of work from the interaction between computer science and finance can be very promising in this area. The last point I want to make is that you have to talk to the practitioners . You cannot just stay in the ivory tower. You have to talk with practitioners like what you guys do here and when we talk to the practitioners, we can recalibrate our thinking process. For instance, in the paper Tokenomics: Dynamic Adoption and Valuation , when I write down the valuation formula, I think it\u2019s reasonable because a lot of practitioners emphasize that when you value the cryptocurrency, you have to value it with respect to the user base. It is like when you value a bank you value the market cap with respect to the book value of equity. And if you look at people on Wall Street nowadays who do a lot of interesting research like Thomas Lee in Fundstrat, they all emphasize the same thing \u2014 the total cap of the cryptocurrency should be linked to the total number of active users \u2014 this goes back to the idea that the currency of a country or digital platform is more valuable when there are more economic activities proxied by the number of users.","title":"Questions 2"},{"location":"articles/AMA/Tokeneconomics%3AWhenMacroandMicroEconomicsUniteinFinance/#questions-3","text":"Zesen: Thank you for sharing three points about how cryptocurrency and platform tokens promote collaboration between scholars and cooperative firms and how computer science can be interdisciplinary for monetary economics and collaboration between academia and industry which definitely support a real usage of the new technology. I think this one would be the last question for this interview which is related to Dfinity\u2019s Internet Computer. The Internet Computer, IC, in short, is the first frictionless blockchain with web speed and the Internet-scale throughout the world. It extends the functionality of the public Internet so that it can be hosting software, transforming it into a global computing platform. So do you think Internet Computer or any other decentralized technology can solve the blockchain trilemma, which isdecentralization, scalability, and security? And how do you think the Internet Computer can possibly empower the financial industry and your research in this area? Prof. Li: Since we don\u2019t have a lot of time left, I\u2019ll just cut my answer short. The short answer is yes, and I think it is a very promising project. I think it is a very good idea of web 3.0 based on decentralized computing. Going back to what we talked about before, the theme of our conversation today is that if you want a cryptocurrency to succeed, you better build a good platform that can support a variety of economic activities, because the more economic activities, the better the cryptocurrency performs. So, to my knowledge, Dfinity has its own cryptocurrency with very sophisticated tokenomics, especially the deflationary force is directly linked to what people can do on this platform. And people can do a lot of things if you enable decentralized computing. The predecessor of decentralized computing is edge computing. Figure 8: Edge Computing We all have mobile devices and we can do computation on mobile devices, we can enable some remote computers to access our mobile devices and do computation there. So decentralized computing can certainly enable a lot of things. So I think it is a very promising project because it can enable a lot of blockchain-based activities. Another thing I want to mention is scalability. So I have first to admit that I am not an expert on Dfinity itself so I just try to read as much as I can. But to my knowledge, it is quite a scalable network. Because the more people join the platform, the more computational power the platform will have. If we have more computational power, the throughput of the payment system can be increased. This is quite different from Bitcoin. I am not going to comment on Ethereum since I am still trying to learn Ethereum 2.0 and the transition from proof of work to proof of stake \u2014 but to my knowledge, Bitcoin has very limited throughput because of the particular design of tokenomics. When more people want to transact, they just over-bid each other in terms of the transaction fees. But when the transaction fees go up, this would invite more and more miners since they want to mine the Bitcoin and earn the transaction fee. But when more miners come onto the network, it is more difficult to reach a decentralized consensus among the increasing number of miners. There is a dilemma of bitcoin adoption scalability and I recommend a paper from Fahad from Wake Forest University and Kose John and Franz J. Hinzen from New York University, they have a great paper on the limited adoption of Bitcoin exactly about this point. But to my understanding, Dfinity is not subject to this problem, so that\u2019s why I am particularly optimistic on the scalability side. In terms of security, I don\u2019t have a lot to say about this because I am not an expert in cyber security. But I know they do have a lot of great scientists working on this, so let\u2019s see. I think in the future, we\u2019re going to see a lot of news coming from this project and I am looking forward to their achievements. Xinyu: Thank you so much, this is all for the interview. Prof. Li: Thank you for inviting me and I look forward to your other interviews and all your publications.

About Mr. Derrick Adam Introduction to Graduate Mentor Derrick Adam: Figure 1: Mr. Derrick Adam Derrick Adam is entering his second year of the Master in Economics and Computer Science program at Duke University. Derrick graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in finance from St. John\u2019s University in 2017. Before starting his Master\u2019s degree, he worked at a small private equity firm in Boston and then moved into asset management at Vanguard. This summer he worked remotely as an analyst for New Frontier Bio, a biotech startup in Cambridge, Massachusetts. He also served as a Graduate Student Mentor in the CS+ program. The project the undergraduate student researchers and he collaborated on was: Decentralized Finance: Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies on the Internet Computer. This fall he hopes to continue research on the CS+ project and will be remotely interning at SuMi TRUST. In the distant future, he hopes to leverage his technical and financial skills as a venture capitalist making investments in biotech and fintech companies that will positively impact humanity. Watch the interview documentary on SciEcon YouTube Channel : Read the Interview Scripts with annotations and references: Questions 1 Xinyu: As you are the project mentor for these excellent students, we have a few questions for you today, and let\u2019s start the questions. So the first question. We know that the CS+ team is currently working on some research and development activities on Internet Computer [1]. Could you give a brief introduction to the Duke CS+ project? And what is the incentive behind this project and what is it about? Derrick: The name of the project is called decentralized finance blockchain and cryptocurrencies on the Internet. And in short, the project is for the students to understand how to do research and be resourceful in computer science and economics, and the main task for them is to deploy decentralized finance Apps or canisters [2] on the Internet Computer with key features being Defi Apps [3] or just a smart contract that currently exists on the Ethereum [4] blockchain. Figure 2: Internet Computer And we want the students to conduct research to compare the performance of these decentralized client Apps that are newly developed on the Internet Computer to the Ethereum blockchain that currently exists. And, at the end of the program, we\u2019re hoping that the students can successfully develop and create a live web application on the Internet Computer and present the application at the SciEcon Accelerator seminar and may possibly submit a proposal for further publishable research if possible. Questions 2 Zesen: We know that two months have passed since the launch of the Duke CS+ project. So could you please summarize what are the significant achievements in the past two months of the Duke CS+ project? Derrick: Two students Dylan and Malika are in the Compound and Aave team and they renamed their project ICy, and then we have the Liquity [5] team with Rhys and Oum, and they renamed their project WaterPark. And a lot of the progress they have made from start to finish is that they try to build the frontend and backend, especially, with the Internet Computer, they use a language called Motoko [6], and they build some functions similar to how a current bank works, like mint, transfer functions. They built up the frontend, the backend, and they\u2019ve also studied some blockchain and Ethereum related topics such as orthogonal persistence [7] and gas fee [8]. And some research they\u2019ve done includes studying the gas model on Ethereum and the reverse gas model [9] on Dfinity\u2019s Internet Computer and analyzing the economic impacts on users and developers. And there\u2019s also something called the BigMap [10] that another student is doing research on. So there\u2019s a lot of the big ideas that are in blockchain and cryptocurrencies that the students have to dive deeper into and try to approve upon those ideas and apply to their own project, so they can create a wide web application that improves upon the Ethereum blockchain. Figure 3: Shotscreen of Ethereum Website : DeFi Applications Questions 3 Xinyu: Because Internet Computer and DeFi are both very new fields in recent years, and many of them are difficult to access in most university courses. So do you think that exposure to these cutting-edge programs will have any impact on students\u2019 future development? Derrick: I would say that CS+, in general, is a program that doesn\u2019t really exist in many other universities because of the inability of undergraduate students to conduct research on any computer science or data science topic, especially the undergrad sophomore or junior level. It\u2019s an opportunity unique to Duke and I think it should continue and attract more students. More specifically, with this project in blockchain and cryptocurrencies, you know courses and research doesn\u2019t pretty much exist anywhere, whether it be in the United States or internationally. And a lot of consumers and retail investors and even institutions are new to this space, so there\u2019s a lot more work to be done. Figure 4: Blockchain So I think going forward a lot, more courses should be created, and a lot more research opportunities and professors are coming on board at universities to do research and get grants, so further research should continue, cause I think it is one of the ways you can push the boundaries forward of what current research is going on and what new research can be done. Questions 4 Zesen: As we mentioned before, the CS+ group is involved in a very new field of research, which means that the whole industry is not very mature. So as a newcomer, it can be very difficult to learn the entire body of knowledge and to search for information. So did you feel similar difficulties during your tenure as a team mentor or did you encounter any obstacles to the development of the project? Derrick: I think many of us, whether undergraduate and graduate students or even faculty, their main exposure to cryptocurrencies is probably through Robinhood [11] or another broker. A lot of people are buying and selling to make a quick profit on these Apps, but they don\u2019t really know the plumbing behind the blockchains system and what Ethereum is and what smart contracts [12] are, and I was in that boat as well. But through the project, a lot of the topics were difficult for the students and me, like we never heard of orthogonal persistence before and we never heard of Big Map before even Motoko was a new language. Figure 5: DFINITY and Motoko programing language But Dfinity, the company behind the Internet Computer they provide a lot of resources to reach out to, and also there\u2019s a lot of instructional videos, there\u2019s also even some research papers, although you know might be a little bit beyond the scope of the project. You know, there were some resources there as well to look at. But the main thing is that the faculties were extremely helpful like Professor Luyao and Professor Yulin from Economics, Kartik Nayak and Professor Fan from Computer Science, they were extremely helpful to me and the students and very knowledgeable of the feel especially coming from the economics and computer science side, so the students had a lot of people that were entrenched in the field that they can reach out to with any questions. And I think, by doing the project, even when they did run into certain problems, developing Apps, like developing the main functions or drawing up a map so as to write the research papers, they also had university resources like the writing center. You guys at Duke Kunshan University work on similar projects, you know there\u2019s a lot of avenues and venues the students could reach out to, and the same for me as well. Question 5 Xinyu: So do you think in the past two months, the project has lived up to expectations? Was it lacking in certain areas, and what could be improved and will there be more projects like this in the future? Also, Professor Zhang is the project lead of this program and her tenure track is at Duke Kunshan University. Students like us from Duke Kunshan University are working on similar projects led by her as well. So is there any expectation for more collaboration with Duke Kunshan University, and SciEcon CIC in the future? Derrick: Yeah, sure. So I think the project more than lives up to its expectation. I think, like going back to the previous question, I think the fact that it\u2019s a new field, and not a lot of research has been done, and it\u2019s still something new it\u2019s in its earliest stages like cryptocurrencies and blockchain. I think doing a novel project and working on something original has been very fruitful for our learning and also the students\u2019 development skills. And then the second one, I don\u2019t think so, I think the students get a great balance of research and also practical application, and even if beyond the CS+ summer term they have the opportunity to continue doing the research, asking and applying for grants, and even startup competition funding. So I think there\u2019s a lot of different avenues students can go with us beyond the program. And then, what could be improved and will there be more projects like this? I would assume there for sure will be many projects like this because I assume that a lot of faculty in CS will be wanting to do research in this area, and probably there are going to be more courses taught in the field. Even recruiters from these FinTech companies are going to be looking for talent who are exposed in the area. So I think more students will express interest in the field and also faculty and employers will also express interest and that will basically make people want to do more work in the area. And for the improvement of the program, I think the Duke CS+ programs have been going on for a couple of years now, so a lot of the details of the program are already ironed out so I think it is quite smooth. But for me particularly, the faculty have been extremely helpful and organized, and good with scheduling, and on top of the project deadlines, with the students, so I can\u2019t speak for the other teams, but I honestly wouldn\u2019t say there\u2019s anything more that we can do to improve. Figure 6: Duke University Figure 7: SciEcon Accelerator \u00a9\ufe0fSciEcon 2021 And about expectations for more collaboration between DKU and SciEcon in the future, I am not too familiar with SciEcon and also DKU, but what I can say is that the students that are in DKU are brilliant just as the ones here in Durham, so it should only be a wise idea to continue collaborating and having students from DKU work with faculty and students here in Durham, it can only help each other\u2019s learning, it can help each other to become better researchers, better practitioners in the field and even help our faculty as they further their own research, so yes. Question 6 Xinyu: And as you mentioned, you think more and more students will be involved in such programs about Internet Computer and about blockchains and high-tech and more students and talents will be recruited with excellent companies in the industry. So just a very general question and this should be the last question for this interview. It is about cryptocurrencies and blockchain and Fintech. So as technology development is very rapid nowadays, how do you think technologies like blockchain and FinTech will reshape the way that scholars, students, like you, cause we know that you\u2019re the Master of Economics and Math at Duke University, the research way or something else, like your researches and your future plans? Derrick: I think blockchain and cryptocurrency are going to reshape the entire financial services industry. So if you think about it, the total addressable market is basically every financial transaction in the world, it\u2019s going to alter the way peer-to-peer [13] transactions are done between individuals, it\u2019s going to reshape the way lending is done, it\u2019s going to reshape the way people buy and sell items. So the entire financial industry is due for disruption and I think by students and faculty wanting to do research in the area, they can continue to improve upon what\u2019s already there, such as an interest rate model having stable coins, and studying for example, how can you lower the gas fees because right now it\u2019s kind of expensive in Ethereum. But I think all these things will be further research areas for students and faculty and more and more universities, not just Duke because Etherum and all the cryptocurrencies will affect and basically change how we conduct business and all different areas. So I think for students and faculty it will only be more and more opportunities to do research on what\u2019s currently out there, and people that are going into FinTech will find more ways to continue to push the boundaries forward. Xinyu: Thank you so much, and congratulations to the Duke CS+ team. I think this is the end of our interview today, thank you so much for participating.

Derrick: Two students Dylan and Malika are in the Compound and Aave team and they renamed their project ICy, and then we have the Liquity [5] team with Rhys and Oum, and they renamed their project WaterPark. And a lot of the progress they have made from start to finish is that they try to build the frontend and backend, especially, with the Internet Computer, they use a language called Motoko [6], and they build some functions similar to how a current bank works, like mint, transfer functions. They built up the frontend, the backend, and they\u2019ve also studied some blockchain and Ethereum related topics such as orthogonal persistence [7] and gas fee [8]. And some research they\u2019ve done includes studying the gas model on Ethereum and the reverse gas model [9] on Dfinity\u2019s Internet Computer and analyzing the economic impacts on users and developers. And there\u2019s also something called the BigMap [10] that another student is doing research on. So there\u2019s a lot of the big ideas that are in blockchain and cryptocurrencies that the students have to dive deeper into and try to approve upon those ideas and apply to their own project, so they can create a wide web application that improves upon the Ethereum blockchain.

So do you think that exposure to these cutting-edge programs will have any impact on students\u2019 future development? Derrick: I would say that CS+, in general, is a program that doesn\u2019t really exist in many other universities because of the inability of undergraduate students to conduct research on any computer science or data science topic, especially the undergrad sophomore or junior level. It\u2019s an opportunity unique to Duke and I think it should continue and attract more students. More specifically, with this project in blockchain and cryptocurrencies, you know courses and research doesn\u2019t pretty much exist anywhere, whether it be in the United States or internationally. And a lot of consumers and retail investors and even institutions are new to this space, so there\u2019s a lot more work to be done. Figure 4: Blockchain So I think going forward a lot, more courses should be created, and a lot more research opportunities and professors are coming on board at universities to do research and get grants, so further research should continue, cause I think it is one of the ways you can push the boundaries forward of what current research is going on and what new research can be done.","title":"Questions 3"},{"location":"articles/AMA/TowardsDecentralizedProtocols%3ACallforCollaborations/#questions-4","text":"Zesen: As we mentioned before, the CS+ group is involved in a very new field of research, which means that the whole industry is not very mature. So as a newcomer, it can be very difficult to learn the entire body of knowledge and to search for information. So did you feel similar difficulties during your tenure as a team mentor or did you encounter any obstacles to the development of the project? Derrick: I think many of us, whether undergraduate and graduate students or even faculty, their main exposure to cryptocurrencies is probably through Robinhood [11] or another broker. A lot of people are buying and selling to make a quick profit on these Apps, but they don\u2019t really know the plumbing behind the blockchains system and what Ethereum is and what smart contracts [12] are, and I was in that boat as well. But through the project, a lot of the topics were difficult for the students and me, like we never heard of orthogonal persistence before and we never heard of Big Map before even Motoko was a new language. Figure 5: DFINITY and Motoko programing language But Dfinity, the company behind the Internet Computer they provide a lot of resources to reach out to, and also there\u2019s a lot of instructional videos, there\u2019s also even some research papers, although you know might be a little bit beyond the scope of the project. You know, there were some resources there as well to look at. But the main thing is that the faculties were extremely helpful like Professor Luyao and Professor Yulin from Economics, Kartik Nayak and Professor Fan from Computer Science, they were extremely helpful to me and the students and very knowledgeable of the feel especially coming from the economics and computer science side, so the students had a lot of people that were entrenched in the field that they can reach out to with any questions. And I think, by doing the project, even when they did run into certain problems, developing Apps, like developing the main functions or drawing up a map so as to write the research papers, they also had university resources like the writing center. You guys at Duke Kunshan University work on similar projects, you know there\u2019s a lot of avenues and venues the students could reach out to, and the same for me as well.","title":"Questions 4"},{"location":"articles/AMA/TowardsDecentralizedProtocols%3ACallforCollaborations/#question-5","text":"Xinyu: So do you think in the past two months, the project has lived up to expectations? Was it lacking in certain areas, and what could be improved and will there be more projects like this in the future? Also, Professor Zhang is the project lead of this program and her tenure track is at Duke Kunshan University. Students like us from Duke Kunshan University are working on similar projects led by her as well. So is there any expectation for more collaboration with Duke Kunshan University, and SciEcon CIC in the future? Derrick: Yeah, sure. So I think the project more than lives up to its expectation. I think, like going back to the previous question, I think the fact that it\u2019s a new field, and not a lot of research has been done, and it\u2019s still something new it\u2019s in its earliest stages like cryptocurrencies and blockchain. I think doing a novel project and working on something original has been very fruitful for our learning and also the students\u2019 development skills. And then the second one, I don\u2019t think so, I think the students get a great balance of research and also practical application, and even if beyond the CS+ summer term they have the opportunity to continue doing the research, asking and applying for grants, and even startup competition funding. So I think there\u2019s a lot of different avenues students can go with us beyond the program. And then, what could be improved and will there be more projects like this? I would assume there for sure will be many projects like this because I assume that a lot of faculty in CS will be wanting to do research in this area, and probably there are going to be more courses taught in the field. Even recruiters from these FinTech companies are going to be looking for talent who are exposed in the area. So I think more students will express interest in the field and also faculty and employers will also express interest and that will basically make people want to do more work in the area. And for the improvement of the program, I think the Duke CS+ programs have been going on for a couple of years now, so a lot of the details of the program are already ironed out so I think it is quite smooth. But for me particularly, the faculty have been extremely helpful and organized, and good with scheduling, and on top of the project deadlines, with the students, so I can\u2019t speak for the other teams, but I honestly wouldn\u2019t say there\u2019s anything more that we can do to improve. Figure 6: Duke University Figure 7: SciEcon Accelerator \u00a9\ufe0fSciEcon 2021 And about expectations for more collaboration between DKU and SciEcon in the future, I am not too familiar with SciEcon and also DKU, but what I can say is that the students that are in DKU are brilliant just as the ones here in Durham, so it should only be a wise idea to continue collaborating and having students from DKU work with faculty and students here in Durham, it can only help each other\u2019s learning, it can help each other to become better researchers, better practitioners in the field and even help our faculty as they further their own research, so yes.","title":"Question 5"},{"location":"articles/AMA/TowardsDecentralizedProtocols%3ACallforCollaborations/#question-6","text":"Xinyu: And as you mentioned, you think more and more students will be involved in such programs about Internet Computer and about blockchains and high-tech and more students and talents will be recruited with excellent companies in the industry. So just a very general question and this should be the last question for this interview. It is about cryptocurrencies and blockchain and Fintech. So as technology development is very rapid nowadays, how do you think technologies like blockchain and FinTech will reshape the way that scholars, students, like you, cause we know that you\u2019re the Master of Economics and Math at Duke University, the research way or something else, like your researches and your future plans? Derrick: I think blockchain and cryptocurrency are going to reshape the entire financial services industry. So if you think about it, the total addressable market is basically every financial transaction in the world, it\u2019s going to alter the way peer-to-peer [13] transactions are done between individuals, it\u2019s going to reshape the way lending is done, it\u2019s going to reshape the way people buy and sell items. So the entire financial industry is due for disruption and I think by students and faculty wanting to do research in the area, they can continue to improve upon what\u2019s already there, such as an interest rate model having stable coins, and studying for example, how can you lower the gas fees because right now it\u2019s kind of expensive in Ethereum. But I think all these things will be further research areas for students and faculty and more and more universities, not just Duke because Etherum and all the cryptocurrencies will affect and basically change how we conduct business and all different areas. So I think for students and faculty it will only be more and more opportunities to do research on what\u2019s currently out there, and people that are going into FinTech will find more ways to continue to push the boundaries forward. Xinyu: Thank you so much, and congratulations to the Duke CS+ team.

A Letter for Readers Dear Readers: I hope this letter finds you well! Here is the AMA (Ask Me Anything) team from SciEcon. Blockchain provides new opportunities to our economy via decentralization. However, decentralization is only the means but not the ultimate goal. The current decentralized system often falls far behind its centralized counterparts in economic efficiency. Prof. Justin Cappos is an expert in computer science. Abundant research of him improves real-world systems through technology. His research philosophy reflects an ancient Chinese saying, \u201cbeing sageliness within and kingliness without, \u201c i.e., he observes the world rigorously with a grand vision and devotes himself passionately to the advances of humanity. He is a philosopher obsessed with the principle of the world, offering profound insights into Blockchain. He is a warrior at the forefront of academia, benefiting many big-named companies in the industry. He is a king who cares about the whole world, promoting Blockchain\u2019s open-source and inclusiveness. He is also a poet imagining the future. Seattle that he creates empowers the splendid blueprint of P2P. In the interview, Prof. Cappos talked about the vital role of Blockchain in the information and intelligence era. He addressed the dilemma between decentralization and economic efficiency. Then, he shared his optimistic view on content transmission and introduced his team\u2019s latest achievements in improving computational and economic efficiency. Prof. Cappos took the Linux system as an example to illustrate his ambition in an open-source and inclusive blockchain system. Prof. Cappos also inquires DFINITY engineers about the contribution of Internet Computers to our current practice. Now let\u2019s see what insights we can get from Prof. Cappos. Best wishes, SciEcon AMA Listen to the podcast on Buzzsprout 1. What is your motivation for doing research about fintech/blockchain? Figure 4: Centralized vs Decentralized vs Distributed Network: An Overview Prof. Cappos: People around me care about blockchain I saw many people starting to talk about and work on different things related to blockchain and its potential. I specifically saw people doing resource-backed cryptocurrencies, things like Filecoin [1], and other things meant to provide some tangible good, or at least computational tangible good. I looked a lot about the systems and didn\u2019t think they necessarily make a lot of sense. Centralization is more efficient than decentralization Because in general, if you have a good, like storage, memory, and computer power, that\u2019s more efficient to centralize, then your system has this natural gravity where you end up with a lot of the mining power being centralized, which defeats a lot of purposes of having a decentralized system. For instance, the largest Bitcoin mining pools comprise scary amounts of computational power and could potentially do quite harmful things, specifically if a few of them collaborate. What good can a decentralized system bring to us? Once again, the problem is that they are not really that decentralized. And secondly, your incentives are pulling you toward centralization because centralized solutions usually are much more efficient than decentralized ones. I looked into this and thought would anything make sense in this space. That is how I get started and try to convince myself if anything would actually make sense here. 2. Can you briefly highlight your research in the field of fintech/blockchain? Figure 5: Open Source Initiative Prof. Cappos: Content delivery is where we can make a change Specifically, I have an interest in resource-backed cryptocurrency. In general, fintech or other blockchain solutions make more sense than resource-backed ones tend to. I think they have a long way to go, and they have a whole set of problems. Resource-backed cryptocurrencies, for me, are something that I try to understand if I think there is something meaningful here because of the nature of the system. Six years ago, I started to think about this problem fairly seriously. Since these resources, such as computer memory, bandwidth between nodes, storage, are more efficient for Google to provide in data centers, and home users try to get these, are there some resources that really need to be decentralized? The most promising one I could think of was content delivery, the CDN networks [2]. CDN is basically when you want to watch movies, they are being retrieved from nodes very close to you rather than a server at the original company that actually has it. That is what makes Netflix and YouTube\u2019s services faster because the videos are closer. We built an efficient decentralized system and commercialized it As I have targeted resources, the big problems were: Can you do this securely and efficiently? In terms of efficiency, I\u2019m not just saying computational efficiency, but also economic efficiency. I spent four-plus years working with my Ph.D. students on a lot of these problems. To be honest, a bit to my surprise, we were able to build a system that is quite efficient and seems to have all the right economic and security properties and actually be successful in the marketplace. And then, we founded a start-up, did a little bit of work there, and handed the technology over to the Linux Foundation. We have a bunch of folks working to commercialize it. We are working to make this something community-driven, in the spirit of open-source software and an open, mutually beneficial ecosystem where all participants can direct value that is not tightly controlled by only one company in this space. Modeling Linux, we try to make all participants equal in the ecosystem I have seen a lot of systems where for-profit companies or foundations make all the money. So, I also tried my best to make it more like an open-source project that meets an economic marketplace. Imagine something like a sporting league, where anyone can put a team together and compete and the league-provided umpires keep it fair. The umpires obviously have to be insulated from influence and you need a robust series of checks and balances. Fortunately, open-source projects and non-profit foundations when run correctly, have experience with handling these sorts of conflicts. Anyone who wants to come, and play is on equal footing with other people in the ecosystem. That\u2019s really how you end up with the best ecosystem possible. The reason why Linux is the most successful operating system in the world has everything to do with the fact that anybody and everybody pitches in to fix issues despite the fact that Microsoft makes an enormous amount of money from the operating system and spent an enormous amount on it. I think Linux is really the success story and the thing we are trying to model. 3. How do you think the Internet Computer can possibly empower your research? What support do you need to innovate with the Internet Computer? What technique questions do you have for the DFINITY engineers? Figure 6: DFINITY Internet Computer Prof. Cappos: I think much of the Internet Computer\u2019s introduction is for marketing pitch focus. In general, it\u2019s not very clear what problems they are solving. Other than that, there don\u2019t exist decentralized internet computers. If I come to you and say I want to build a quantum computer because physics is cool and everybody likes physics, that might not be a good reason. But if we say we can crack all kinds of cryptographic codes, solve legitimate problems, and save billions of dollars a year by doing this, then you will be interested. I am not sure what problems they are solving because running smart contracts isn\u2019t the problem we have right now. Or maybe it\u2019s a solution to a problem I don\u2019t know. My questions for DFINITY developers would be: In what domains are you solving problems? What problems are you solving over what\u2019s currently being done? And how? Because now, I can go to Amazon\u2019s EC2 [3] and rent computing power. There are other systems to output like EdgeNet , they provide computing to academic researchers. I built a peer-to-peer computing platform called Seattle that ran for many years that provides that sort of computation. I\u2019m not sure what real-world issues they are solving with their computational platform. Figure 7: Seattle : Open Peer-to-Peer Computing Figure 8: Logo of Edgenet Conclusion Prof. Cappos\u2019s questions for DFINITY engineers and developers: 1. We can already run smart contracts in the Ethereum blockchain. What specific advantages does the Internet Computer have over Ethereum in running smart contracts? How does the importance of DFINITY manifest in this space? 2. How does the Internet Computer ensure that it provides a truly decentralized system? What technologies help contribute to this landscape and how? 3. We can get computing services from Amazon EC2, EdgeNet, and other platforms. So, what\u2019s new can DFINITY bring to issues about computations? How differently does the Internet Computer empower computing than the existing technologies? Relevant Materials [1] Filecoin: \u25a0 What is Filecoin? Filecoin (\u2a0e) is an open-source, public cryptocurrency and digital payment system intended to be a blockchain-based cooperative digital storage and data retrieval method. \u25a0 What problems does Filecoin try to solve? Unlike cloud-storage companies like Amazon Web Services or Cloudflare, which are prone to the problems of centralization, Filecoin leverages its decentralized nature to protect the integrity of a data\u2019s location, making it easily retrievable and hard to censor.

CDN is abbreviated for a content delivery network or content distribution network. CDN is a geographically distributed network of proxy servers and their data centers. The goal is to provide high availability and performance by distributing the service spatially relative to end-users. \u25a0 What good can CDN bring to us? CDN nodes are usually deployed in multiple locations. Benefits include reducing bandwidth costs, improving page load times, or increasing the global availability of content. \u25a0 How do CDN providers profit? Traditionally, CDN providers profit either from direct fees paid by content providers using their network, or profit from the user analytics and tracking data collected as their scripts are being loaded onto customers\u2019 websites inside their browser origin.

In terms of efficiency, I\u2019m not just saying computational efficiency, but also economic efficiency. I spent four-plus years working with my Ph.D. students on a lot of these problems. To be honest, a bit to my surprise, we were able to build a system that is quite efficient and seems to have all the right economic and security properties and actually be successful in the marketplace. And then, we founded a start-up, did a little bit of work there, and handed the technology over to the Linux Foundation. We have a bunch of folks working to commercialize it. We are working to make this something community-driven, in the spirit of open-source software and an open, mutually beneficial ecosystem where all participants can direct value that is not tightly controlled by only one company in this space. Modeling Linux, we try to make all participants equal in the ecosystem I have seen a lot of systems where for-profit companies or foundations make all the money. So, I also tried my best to make it more like an open-source project that meets an economic marketplace. Imagine something like a sporting league, where anyone can put a team together and compete and the league-provided umpires keep it fair. The umpires obviously have to be insulated from influence and you need a robust series of checks and balances. Fortunately, open-source projects and non-profit foundations when run correctly, have experience with handling these sorts of conflicts. Anyone who wants to come, and play is on equal footing with other people in the ecosystem. That\u2019s really how you end up with the best ecosystem possible. The reason why Linux is the most successful operating system in the world has everything to do with the fact that anybody and everybody pitches in to fix issues despite the fact that Microsoft makes an enormous amount of money from the operating system and spent an enormous amount on it. I think Linux is really the success story and the thing we are trying to model.","title":"Prof. Cappos:"},{"location":"articles/AMA/TowardsIncentivizedDecentralization%3ATheFutureofBlockchain/#3-how-do-you-think-the-internet-computer-can-possibly-empower-your-research-what-support-do-you-need-to-innovate-with-the-internet-computer-what-technique-questions-do-you-have-for-the-dfinity-engineers","text":"Figure 6: DFINITY Internet Computer","title":"3.

About the Interviewees Introduction to Rhys Banerjee Figure 1: Rhys Banerjee Rhys is a rising Junior at Duke University currently majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Mathematics. Since June 1st he has been on the Decentralized Finance team at the CS+ program at Duke. They have been leveraging the Internet Computer to build a decentralized undercollateralized lending protocol consisting of an exchange of ICP to an SDR-pegged stablecoin. This project has taught him much about both coding, collaboration, and academic research into the field of blockchain, which I was initially mostly unfamiliar with. Introduction to Oum Lahade Figure 2: Oum Lahade Oum is a rising Sophomore at Duke University studying Electrical & Computer Engineering and Mathematics with a minor in Finance. This summer, he has been working to create a decentralized borrowing protocol called WaterPark, modeled off the Liquity protocol on Ethereum, on the Internet Computer. Learning about the Internet Computer has taught him a lot about blockchain and various innovations within the field while developing the protocol has endowed him with greater teamwork and project management skills. Watch the interview documentary on SciEcon YouTube channel : Read the Interview Scripts with annotations and citations. Questions 1 Xinyu: We know that you have joined the Duke CS+ group and are working on a project named WaterPark related to the Internet Computer and distributed finance, so can you please give us a brief introduction to your project, including its expectation and objectives? Oum: Sure, I can start. So WaterPark is a decentralized borrowing protocol on the Internet Computer [1] Network, which is modeled off the Liquity [2] protocol on Ethereum [3]. So here the general idea is that the user will deposit ICP [4] tokens, which are the native tokens of the Internet Computer, into these things, called Troves, which are essentially debt accounts, on WaterPark. And after they deposit ICP tokens on WaterPark they will be able to take out a stable coin, pegged to the SDR [5], that is over collateralized from the system. And so the idea here is that they can use the stable coin to create stable smart contracts or canisters [6] on the Internet Computer Network while still having the price appreciation that ICP tokens offer. Figure 3: Liquity Xinyu: So Rhys, do you want to add something? Rhys: Yeah. There\u2019s not really much to add beyond that, I mean I feel like he pretty much covered the essentials of WaterPark. It is based on the already existing Liquity protocol, but we had to make a few adaptations, just in terms of using ICP tokens instead of Ether tokens. And we\u2019re going to be implementing our own stable coin [7] pegged to Internet Computer cycles, as opposed to the LUSD [8] stable coin for Liquity. But I feel like Oum has pretty much covered everything. Questions 2 Zesen: Thank you so much. So as you said, unlike most of the theoretical learning that takes place in the university courses, the project you\u2019re working on is such an integrated activity that combines research and technical practice. So, could you please briefly talk about your incentives for starting this project and did this kind of project help you in your studies or in your future career? Rhys: So I am actually not from a finance background, I am more from a computer science or math background, and I am more like an amateur with an interest in blockchain. In terms of my interest in this project, I was interested mainly because we were going to be working with new technologies like the Internet Computer. And I was interested in the prospects of making a DeFi [9] protocol on this level of technology. Figure 4: Defi protocols Oum: This project essentially stemmed from a previous interest in blockchain, as well as, just understanding Defi architecture which I think is a huge thing going forward. And then, how this project help in our future career? I think, for me, it\u2019s pretty much just been eye-opening to see a new side of finance that\u2019s currently in development, which stands in contrast to a lot of other areas of finance. Questions 3 Xinyu: Cool. So as you have taken two months into the Duke CS+ project, can you give a brief overview of how the project is proceeding so far, or can you share something like your significant achievements that you have already reached? Oum: Sure. So on the development side, we created an MVP [10] (Minimum Viable Product) a few weeks back, and we\u2019ve been refining that and sort of getting that more integrated within the whole Internet Computer network. And then on the research side, we\u2019re currently in the midst of developing our further research proposal, which for both of us revolves around the idea of orthogonal persistence [11] which is something that Dfinity is implemented in a novel way on the Internet Computer. Figure 5: Orthogonal Persistence And so, those have been the two main accomplishments that we have obtained so far. Rhys: Pretty much as Oum said, we have the minimum viable product and we\u2019re also now in the midst of just finalizing our research proposals. My research proposal focuses more on orthogonal persistence as a solution to data storage and Oum focuses more on orthogonal persistence as a solution to efficiency. So our research proposals are similar and a little bit different. That\u2019s pretty much where we are right now in terms of the project as a whole. Xinyu: Congratulations on all your achievements! Questions 4 Zesen: Thank you so much. I think this would be the last question of this interview, which said that you are now working in a completely new field and the technology stack you\u2019re using is very new, such as the Motoko programming language, etc. And relatively speaking, these technologies often do not have a very mature ecology, which means that information retrieval can be very difficult. Have you ever encountered similar problems in your research and how did you resolve them? Rhys: I can speak a little bit to some difficulties that sound more from the fact that the Internet Computer and Motoko [12] are new , which pretty much means that if you run into any sort of issue, there is a large likelihood that you can\u2019t just Google the problem and find some solution on StackOverflow or some other website. I am trying to come up with specifics, but I just know that I have a lot. But I know that one of them that I am encountering right now is issues with the frontend. Me and Malika who is on the other project of the DeFi, we\u2019re running into some issues connecting the frontend and the backend into a cohesive product. And I guess the only solution that is presented right now is contacting other DFinity developers. Because when the technology is so new and the only solution that you can really find is finding other people who are developing on the Internet Computer, you need to come up with some sort of support network. Oum: Yeah and I think I can speak to a very similar experience, as recently as you mentioned earlier the Motoko ecology is not very developed yet. So because of that, the documentation can be at times kind of lacking. For me, most of the problems that I encountered were with the actual integration on the Internet Computer. For example, actually transferring ICP tokens between wallets, or creating a new stable coin and having a canister for that. Figure 6: Token transfer For that, as previously mentioned, the workarounds for that come from posting on the Dfinity forums or talking to different engineers, and I know our CS+ professor has given us the opportunity to submit questions for an AMA which I think should be helpful as well. Rhys: That\u2019s true. Xinyu: Thank you so much, and I guess this is the end of our interview, so thank you for your participation and we\u2019re so looking forward to your future achievement and also other collaborations between DKU and Duke. So thank you so much.

The author Chenyu Wang, majoring in Applied Mathematics and Computational Sciences/Math from the class of 2023 was the Teaching Assistant for this course. Abstract We introduced three data sources related to tokens and initial coins offering (ICO), which provided historical prices, volumes, market cap, ICO prices of different tokens. Subsequently, we showed the step-by-step instructions for the data importing process from two data sources among the three and explained the economic meaning of the data. Finally, we used the imported data to do visualization and found that tokens\u2019 ICO prices and the tokens\u2019 prices when they entered CoinMarketCap (CMC) may be highly linearly correlated. The code and instructions can be found in the GoogleColab Notebook as well (Wang 2021, Source: URL ). Keywords: Data source, tokens, ICO Figure 0: Feature Photo (created by Whimsical). Part I Introduce Data Sources In this section, we briefly introduce three data sources: Messari (Messari\u2019s Crypto Data API, n.d.), CoinmarketCap (CoinMarketCap, n.d), Initial Coin Offering (ICO) data from Piotr\u2019s (2018) GitHub. 1. Messari An application programming interface (API) is a connection between computers or between computer programs, which can help users get data without downloading it). Messari API can be used for crypto prices, market data metrics, on-chain metrics, and qualitative information (asset profiles). Most endpoints are accessible in Messari without an API key, but free API limits the amount of data users can get and the speed at which they get data. \u201cWithout an API key, requests are rate limited to 20 requests per minute and 1000 requests per day. Users that create an account will have slightly higher limits of 30 requests per minute and 2000 requests per day. PRO users have the highest limit at 60 requests per minute up to a maximum of 4000 requests per day\u201d (Messari\u2019s Crypto Data API, n.d). In Messari, users can utilize the Fields and Query function to get the data they want. For example, fields =\u2019 symbol, name, slug\u2019, and query_params = {\u2018start\u2019: \u20182020\u201301\u201301\u2019, \u2018end\u2019: \u20182020\u201303\u201301\u2019, \u2018interval\u2019: \u20181d\u2019, \u2018columns\u2019: \u2018open, close\u2019, \u2018timestamp format: \u2018rfc3339\u2019}. Table 1 shows the sample variables of Messari API. In this unofficial PyPi package (Anwer, 2020), detailed code about Messari API can be found. Table1: Sample variables of Messari API. 2. CoinMarketCap CoinMarketCap (CMC)\u2019s official website claims itself as the world\u2019s most-referenced price-tracking website for crypto assets (CoinMarketCap, n.d), and CoinMarketCap API (Ticker Details | Reference API, n.d) can be used to get cryptocurrency data from CoinMarketCap. The price, market cap, volume of certain tokens are all available. To access it, users must have an API key, and some data can only be accessed with the paid API key, for example, users cannot get historical data with the free API. Table 2 shows the sample variables users can get for different tokens by CMC API. Table 2: Sample variables of CoinMarketCap API. 3. Initial Coin Offering (ICO) data from Piotr Github The last data source is downloaded from Piotr (2018)\u2019s blog titled \u201cPredicting ICO returns with machine learning\u201d. He provided the initial dataset, which includes ICO prices, number of ICO tokens, total supply ratio, and ICO Market Cap. His dataset was created based on Ian Balina ( LinkedIn ), his favorite ICO influencer that has a data-driven approach for selecting ICO investments. Balina collected ICO data from ICObench (ICObench, n.d.) and gave each ICO score, and Piotr added a minimum, maximum, and enter price from CoinMarketCap, and corrected a few ICO prices using data from icodrops.com (ICO drops, n.d) and tokendata.io (Tokendata research, 2021). The dataset is available on Github ( URL ). Table 3 shows the major data of Piotr\u2019s dataset. Table3: Major data of Piotr\u2019s dataset. Figure 1: Decision tree among these three data sources (created by Whimsical). A decision tree is a diagram that shows the various outcomes from a series of decisions. In Fig.1, we showed a decision tree among these three data sources, which helps users to choose the suitable data source for their needs. Part II Import Sample Data 1. Step-by-Step instruction In Part II, we created a panda dataframe by merging Piotr\u2019s dataset and a new dataframe created by the data from CMC for selective tokens. The final cross-section dataset includes 180 tokens such as 0x, 5 Miles, Aave, with features from Piotr\u2019s dataset such as ICO price, ICO market cap, the price of tokens when they enter CMC, and features from CMC including the dates when tokens were added into CMC platform and the prices in CMC on Nov. 5th, 2021 (date when we merged them together). Figure 2 below provides a summary of the whole process. Figure 2: Flow chart of the data importing and processing (created by Whimsical). The code and instructions can be found in the GoogleColab Notebook (Wang 2021, Source: URL ). The final processed data set is shown in Fig. 3. Figure 3: Final processed data set (columns whose names are with * are from CMC). Table 4: Information of variables listed in columns (variables with * are from the CMC). 2. Economic meanings of the variables Index: ICO project ICO, the sales of cryptocurrency tokens to the public, to crowdfund in the technology and blockchain industries, is more and more popular these years (Cong et al., 2021). ICO projects refer to the type of token-funded projects. Before ICO, IPO (Initial Public Offering), the sale of equity to the public, was the main way to crowdfund. An IPO comes with extensive regulations via the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Participation in an IPO is typically limited to accredited investors with over $1 million in net worth, which implies that Both issuing an IPO and participating in an IPO are highly demanding. Unlike IPO, ICO provided opportunities for any investors in the world to be involved, and most purchases are anonymous. Additionally, there are no intermediaries between coin buyers and sellers. The tokens can immediately be sold on the crypto market once they are created (Fora Financial, 2021). Therefore, high participation and efficiency are regarded as the important advantages of ICOs. Columns: Enter_CMC, Number of the ICO tokens, total_supply_ratio reflect the original ICO information. Enter_CMC is influenced by the time they entered CMC, so data_added is also meaningful as well. The number of the ICO tokens and total_supply_ratio indicate the ICO size. Max_CMC, Min_CMC, and ICO market cap reflect the performance of ICO later. Code1: Code for generating the Pandas data frame. Part III Economic Stories with Data Visualization Figure 4: The correlation matrix of some ICO data. To do data visualization, we chose some variables (ICO_Price, Total_Supply_Ratio, ICO_Market_Cap, Number_of_ICO_Tokens, Enter_CMC) to calculate the linear correlation coefficients, and show them by the heatmap, which is more direct. The heatmap we got is shown in Fig.4. Referring to the heatmap, we concluded that only the Enter_CMC and ICO prices are highly linearly related, while other variables are not as linearly related since most of their linear correlation coefficients are less than 0.4. ICO prices refer to the tokens\u2019 prices when issuing ICO. After ICO, these tokens can be bought in the crypto market instantly. CMC, as the website for price-tracking of token assets, will add these tokens soon. The prices when tokens are added into CMC are Enter_CMC. If the result is valid, one possible explanation is that intervals between ICO and the time when tokens are added into CMC are relatively small. In a short period, the differences in tokens\u2019 performance are not that much. The entering CMC prices of most tokens will increase at a similar rate based on the ICO prices, resulting in a high linear correlation between entering CMC prices and ICO prices.

Overview 1. 1. Introduction Figure 1: Grant Programs On May 25th, 2021, Dfinity launched the DFINITY Developer Grant Program and as of September 29th, 2021, the program has committed a cumulative total of $1,145,000 in developer grants, with individual grants ranging from $5,000 to $25,000. These grants are used to fund projects that can potentially promote diversity and drive faster development of the software ecosystem of the Internet Computer . As defined in Cambridge Dictionary, the development grants are money given by a government or other organization to create a business or to help a business grow, especially in an area with a lot of unemployed people. For developers, these grant programs are a wonderful opportunity to realize their ideas, which can support projects that are innovative but lack the funds to keep progressing. For companies, nowadays, it is becoming more difficult to boost their technology on a large scale just by relying on their own R&D power. Thanks to the convenience of the Internet, massive technology-based companies or entities such as DFINITY are growing their ecological clusters with the power of external developers . The developer grant is one of the key channels through which these technology entities fund external developers. 1.2. Motivation The motivation for a company or entity to distribute developer grants is straightforward. First, the companies want to catalyze the expansion of their software ecology. New platforms and software ecosystems often require a continuous and substantial infusion of new blood to sustain and grow, especially in the face of intense competition among existing major platforms. This is one of the reasons why there are more developer grants projects on blockchain application platforms such as the Ethereum and the Internet Computer. Moreover, these grant programs also make the emerging blockchain companies competitive in the face of the huge ecological system of the traditional centralized Internet. Figure 2: Developer Community Second, there is a demand to collect ideas from external communities. It is often difficult for platform maintainers to ensure that the software ecology is all-inclusive, in other words, the homogeneity within the platform might emerge. The developer community, however, is extremely diverse. Grant programs encourage the developer community to input various ideas into the ecosystem. The diversity of these ideas greatly complements the shortcoming of homogeneity within the ecosystem. 2. Popular Developer Grant Programs There are currently a very large number of developer grant programs on the Internet, particularly in the area of decentralized finance (DeFi). There is a handy website for browsing grants in the DeFi area: https://www.defigrants.org/ . In this section, we list a few popular developer grant programs for illustration and comparison. 2.1. DFINITY Developer Grant Program Figure 3: DFINITY Developer Grant Program DFINITY is an NPO focused on developing technology for the Internet Computer blockchain.

The Gnosis Ecosystem Fund encourages developers to use Gnosis products to develop products that will enrich the Ethereum ecosystem. Company/Organization: Gnosis Topics Available: Product based on Gnosis\u2019 platform or product, prediction markets/Futarchy, Market mechanism, Governance, Dapp useability, Dapp scalability Amount of Grant: $5,000 to $100,000 Information required for application: Project Information: project description, targeted problems to be solved, project goal, technical description Development Plan: milestones, overall time frame Team Information: your programming portfolio, a brief description of your team, other sources of funding you applied (if applicable) Funding Information: the number of funds to request From the application materials released by major grant programs, it appears that they have similar general requirements for candidate projects, with some special requirements based on the characteristics of the organization. Explicit selectable topics Most grant programs have clear restrictions on the topics of the projects. In general, projects submitted must be related to the use of the organization\u2019s products or expand the ecosystem of the organization\u2019s platform. Requirements for project completion Some grant programs do not accept projects that have not yet been started, especially from large volume companies such as Epic Games. These companies or organizations have a more mature software ecosystem and documentation to help developers achieve semi-finished products more quickly so that the organization can better assess the potential value of the project. Project and funding plan The plan for project development is a basic requirement. The various stages of development and the expected outcomes need to be defined before the application is submitted. If the amount of funding requested is large, a breakdown of the allocation of funds needs to be specified. Biographical information and project experience Generally, large projects place more emphasis on the developer\u2019s project experience. Due to the large number of applicants, large volume companies need to screen for more promising projects by ranking personal experience. Therefore, beginner developers can focus on applying for grants offered by small-volume entities. 3. How to select your grant project This section gives a brief introduction to a rough process of selecting the most suitable developer grant program. Figure 8 gives a flowchart for this process. Figure 8: Process of selecting grant program 3.1. Project Experience The first thing to consider is your and your team\u2019s project experience. As mentioned before, large programs sometimes use previous project experiences as an indicator to screen candidates. Beginners need to be prepared to be rejected when applying to large grant programs and can gain experience by applying to many smaller grants first. 3.2. Platform The choice of platform is always one of the ultimate factors in choosing a grant project. Software developers often only fund developers who use their software. For example, DFINITY only funds developers who develop on the Internet Computer; Epic Games only sponsors. Therefore, before choosing a grant program, be sure to check in advance the software and platform offered by the company you are interested in, vice versa. 3.3. Filter Grants by Project Topics If you don\u2019t have a project idea yet, it is recommended for you to draft a project proposal by first looking up organizations or platforms that interest you, based on the topics of projects they offer. If you already have a project idea or are working on some projects, you can find a sponsor by searching whether the provider of tools and platforms you are using has a grant program, or if other organizations sponsor the type of project you are working on. 3.4. Draft the Application Next, you need to draft a grant application. Depending on the grant program you have chosen, the materials required for the application varies. You can find detailed information in the explanatory materials provided by the grant organization. However, these materials generally include team information, project information, development schedule and plans, details of how funds will be used, etc. 3.5. Submit Now, you can submit all the information you have prepared and wait for the good news. 4. Hackathon In addition to the traditional grant programs, there is a more specific and popular method of obtaining development funding \u2014 the Hackathon. Hackathon is a type of event that brings together a large number of people to form groups and engage in computer programming, and the goal of a Hackathon is to create some software or hardware with specific functions at the end of the event. The hackathon is divided into two forms: offline and online. With the development of the Internet, online hackathons are becoming more and more popular. There are thousands of hackathon projects to choose from. Here is a handy website for searching for ongoing hackathon projects https://devpost.com/hackathons Figure 9: Devpost \u2014 Hackathon On this website, you\u2019re able to easily filter the proper hackathon projects by time, location, number of prizes, and even some topic tags. 4.1. Example Here we will provide an example hackathon project to explain the general pattern of a hackathon project. Project Name: Celo\u2019s Make Crypto Mobile Hackathon Link: https://mobiledefi.devpost.com/?ref_feature=challenge&ref_medium=discover Project Requirements Figure 10: Project Requirement Compared to other developer grant programs, the hackathon has more detailed requirements for the submitted work. Figure 10 shows the requirements for this project. Similar to the developer grant, the hackathon sponsors require participants to use a specific platform to complete their work. In addition, there are more detailed and strict requirements for the functionality of the work. 4.2. Agenda Figure 11: Hackathon Agenda Typically, hackathon organizers will provide a detailed schedule. The events on the schedule are more flexible and may include some tutorials on the use of the platform or software, presentations by sponsors, or project submissions. It is important to read through the schedule carefully. 4.3. Prizes Figure 12: Prize List Of course, you can also check out the various awards and prizes offered by the hackathon. Besides, the hackathon is a great starting point for applying for funding. One of the big reasons we recommend hackathons is that it is not as cumbersome to apply for as a traditional grant program. It not only improves your skills but also enriches your project experience and helps you apply for subsequent grant programs. 5. Conclusion Developer grant programs are really good opportunities for developers to realize their dream ideas. Although your application might fail, the process of finding and applying for grant programs can still give you a chance to explore different companies or organizations. This article gives you an overview of the definition, motivation, and methodology for choosing developer grant programs, but only a brief one. You definitely need to research more by yourself before applying for a program. In addition, we introduce a type of program that is more suitable for novice starters \u2014 hackathon, which can help you quickly accumulate project experience and improve your programming skill. Anyway, developer grants and hackathons are always an excellent chance for you to understand more about the developer\u2019s world, just go for it!

These grants are used to fund projects that can potentially promote diversity and drive faster development of the software ecosystem of the Internet Computer . As defined in Cambridge Dictionary, the development grants are money given by a government or other organization to create a business or to help a business grow, especially in an area with a lot of unemployed people. For developers, these grant programs are a wonderful opportunity to realize their ideas, which can support projects that are innovative but lack the funds to keep progressing. For companies, nowadays, it is becoming more difficult to boost their technology on a large scale just by relying on their own R&D power. Thanks to the convenience of the Internet, massive technology-based companies or entities such as DFINITY are growing their ecological clusters with the power of external developers . The developer grant is one of the key channels through which these technology entities fund external developers.","title":"1. 1.

First, the companies want to catalyze the expansion of their software ecology. New platforms and software ecosystems often require a continuous and substantial infusion of new blood to sustain and grow, especially in the face of intense competition among existing major platforms. This is one of the reasons why there are more developer grants projects on blockchain application platforms such as the Ethereum and the Internet Computer. Moreover, these grant programs also make the emerging blockchain companies competitive in the face of the huge ecological system of the traditional centralized Internet. Figure 2: Developer Community Second, there is a demand to collect ideas from external communities. It is often difficult for platform maintainers to ensure that the software ecology is all-inclusive, in other words, the homogeneity within the platform might emerge. The developer community, however, is extremely diverse. Grant programs encourage the developer community to input various ideas into the ecosystem. The diversity of these ideas greatly complements the shortcoming of homogeneity within the ecosystem.","title":"1.2.

The author Jingwei Li, majoring in Data Science from the class of 2023 were the Teaching Assistant for this course. Abstract This paper introduces three data sources and how to get access to them. Afterward, one data source is picked to demonstrate how to process the data we want. Finally, data visualizations are provided, and possible research topics based on the data are proposed. This work is constructed as the following structure: 1. Introduction of the three data sources; 2. How to import the sample data. 2. Data visualization and economic stories. The complete code and detailed instructions can be found in the Google Colab Notebook (Li 2021, Source: URL). The structure of this work is shown in Figure 1 . Figure 1: Feature picture of the work (created by Whimsical). Part I Introduce Data Source In this section, we briefly introduce three data sources: Coin Metrics API (COINMETRICS, 2021), Messari API (messari.io, 2021), and Defi Pulse Data (Defi Pulse Data, 2021). For each data source, we provide a table containing the major variables of each data source. 1. Coin Metrics API Coin Metrics is a data set that is available through a new, unified, simple-to-use API. In this tutorial, we will introduce the Coin Metrics Python API v4 client library, which is an official Python API client for Coin Metrics API v4 . Coin data such as available markets, coin metrics, available frequencies are provided in the data set. We can use a free API key (community API) to get access. This open-source dataset is also updated daily on its Github ( URL ). For detailed information, you can go to API Client Spec for reference. Table 1 provides the major variables available in Coin Metrics API: Table 1: Major variables of Coin Metrics API. 2. Messari API Messari API can provide crypto prices, market data metrics, on-chain metrics, and qualitative information (asset profile). Messari is an open-source data set that can be accessed without an API. Besides using an API, this data resource is also updated on its Github ( URL ). Table 2 provides the major variables in Coin Metrics API: Table 2: Major variables of Messari API. 3. Defi Pulse Data DeFi Pulse Data is a free data resource that provides Ethereum and DeFi data, which can be accessed through API. In this section, we introduce defipulsedata which is an unofficial Python SDK for the DeFi Pulse Data. DeFi Pulse provides users with 2000 API credits every month. Some of the data require API credits, for detailed information please refer to the official document . In Table 3 , we provide the major variables of Defi Pulse Data. For the complete API endpoints, you can refer to this link . Table 3: Major indicators in Defi Pulse Data. Figure 2 provides the decision tree for the previous three data sources we have mentioned. In the figure, we point out the recommended usage scenarios for the three datasets. It is important to point out that each of these three datasets provides a large and complete number, and their application scenarios are actually difficult to represent in a decision tree. Here we select the advantages of these three data sets. In other words, users should flexibly choose data sets according to their own needs in the actual use process. Figure 2: Decision Tree for the three data sources (created by Whimsical). Part II Import Sample Data In this section, we will create a Dataframe (DF) by using the data in the Coin Metrics API which is likely to be used in future research. To be specific, we focus on the bitcoin-USD market and investigate the ordering information of this market. The section is constructed as follows: first, we introduce how to get the data and generate a pandas DF step by step; Secondly, we explain in detail the economic meaning of the variables. 1. Step-by-step instructions we are targetting the order book data in the bitcoin-USD market (time series data). An order book is an electronic list of buy and sell orders for a specific security or financial instrument organized by price level ( Kenton, 2021 ). The columns (features) we want to include market (market name), time (UTC), amount, price (in terms of USD), and side (buy or sell). Figure 3 provides an overview of how to generate a DF by using Coin Metrics API . Figure 3: Step by Step Instruction to generate a DF in Coin Metrics API (created by Whimsical). 2. Economic meaning of the variables. The processed data sets include market (market name), time (UTC), amount, price (in terms of USD), and side (buy or sell). With these features, we are able to show the trend of the selling prices and buying prices in a given period, in this case, 2021\u201311\u201305 22:50:00 to 2021\u201311\u201305 23:00:00. Table 4 shows the information of variables listed in the DF we will use. Figure 2 shows an overview of the DF we generate. Each observation is a bid to buy or sell the number of assets at a given time. Table 4: Information of variables listed in columns. Figure 2: An overview of the DF. Code 1: Code for generating the Pandas data frame Part III Economic Stories with Data Visualization In this section, we visualize the processed data. Figure 3 shows the BTC-USD order book in a given period. The x-axis represents the price of Bitcoin in USD while the y-axis represents the bidding amount for buyers or sellers. The red line is the selling curve, and the green one is the buying curve. Figure 3 implies that: 1. when prices increase, both amount to buy and to sell decreases. 2. The decrease in selling has an obvious lag compared to the buying curve. This is quite intuitive since people are more likely willing to sell at higher prices but not to buy. Figure 3. BTC-USD order book in a given period. Code 2: Code for visualizing the BTC-USD order book.

For the complete API endpoints, you can refer to this link . Table 3: Major indicators in Defi Pulse Data. Figure 2 provides the decision tree for the previous three data sources we have mentioned. In the figure, we point out the recommended usage scenarios for the three datasets. It is important to point out that each of these three datasets provides a large and complete number, and their application scenarios are actually difficult to represent in a decision tree. Here we select the advantages of these three data sets. In other words, users should flexibly choose data sets according to their own needs in the actual use process.

It brings the Ethereum community together in small groups and provides a joint-built platform for in-depth cross-disciplinary cooperation and discussions, and more information can be found via their tweets . ETHconomics is one of the series at Devconnect, and it is a one-day session gathering researchers and developers in industry and academia looking to broaden our understanding of Ethereum economics and discussing the topics related to the economics of the Ethereum network. There are altogether 16 research presentations in this session, where topics include layer-2 rollups [2], blockchain consensus [3], transaction fee mechanism [4], cryptoeconomics [5], game theory , etc. The main event organizer and coordinator Barnab\u00e9 Monnot says in his LinkedIn post that: Talk subjects ranged from game theory to protocol economics, theory and empirical studies, system design, modeling and simulation\u2026 ETHconomics reflected both the interdisciplinary nature of cryptoeconomics and the excitement that comes from putting the pieces together. Presenters include both academic scholars and industry professionals, and they come from various backgrounds, ranging from computer science, data science, and economics, to describe how Science and Economics meet and integrate with each other on Ethereum blockchain. More information about the speakers and presentations can be found in the Appendix. Figure 3: Devconnect Prof Tim Roughgarden was invited to make a keynote speech, titled as Mechanism Design for Ethereum and Beyond , to give an overview of the game-theoretical analysis of EIP-1559, the improved proposal of Ethereum transaction fee mechanism design, and proposed several desirable open research directions to enlighten the scholars present. Recap of presentation Right after Prof Tim Roughgarden\u2019s keynote on the theoretical aspects of mechanism design for Ethereum, Prof Fan Zhang and Prof Luyao Zhang presented their interdisciplinary research on the empirical analysis of EIP-1559, which ensembles Computer Science and Economics to converse, research, and innovate on Ethereum Blockchain. The presentation slide is available via Docsend . You can also access their working paper online through arXiv , as well as the open-access data and code through GitHub . By making use of rich and valuable data from collected mempool, Ethereum blockchain, and exchanges, their work figured out three exciting major results to comply with the current theoretical results: T ransaction Fee: EIP-1559 has a negligible effect on the gas fee levels, however, it mitigates the intra-block difference of gas fee paid. With the technique of causal inference, the researchers find that with the block features: block size and block height, and exchange features: volatility and return of investment of Ether controlled, the median gas fee does not change much. This finds an echo with Roughgarden\u2019s theoretical result that London Fork is not a solution for scalability, that is, as the adoption rate of EIP-1559 increases, intra-block gas fee volatility decreases significantly. These results mainly imply that in the future we should further increase user experience by making fee estimation easier because people tend to be bounded rational. Figure 4: Transaction Fee: Visualization on Intra-block Gas Price Volatilities (Source: Copyright@Fan Zhang and Luyao Zhang 2022 ) W aiting Time: EIP-1559 helps to reduce the users\u2019 waiting time and the time evaluation of opportunity cost to transact on Ethereum. This research group set up four Ethereum nodes across the globe to make the collection of ephemeral mempool data happen. They also created an innovative approach to deal with the issue of 50% negative waiting time in the previous research, by correcting that the calculation of the waiting time is not to use the timestamp where the transaction is included in the blockchain, but the next timestamp due to the feature of Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism. With this correct calculation, researchers find that the average waiting time decreases from 17 seconds to 10 after London Fork, probably due to an easier fee estimation and variable size of blocks. Figure 5: Waiting Time: Visualization on Block Median Waiting Time (Source: Copyright@Fan Zhang and Luyao Zhang 2022 ) C onsensus Security: EIP-1559 does not have a huge impact on consensus security even though the block size has been increased. The researchers argue that EIP-1559 may negatively impact the security issue in the Ethereum blockchain, but the extent of the impact is modest. They broke the analysis of the consensus security into three dimensions: fork rate, network load, and incentives (Miner Extractable Value, simplified as MEV). They find out that the introduction of variable block size in EIP-1559 is likely to account for why the fork rate has increased by 3%, despite the London Fork, the Ethereum blockchain is still operating at a lower load than before. At the same time, as empirical data shows that MEV is becoming a larger share of the revenue from miners\u2019 point of view, researchers conjecture that miners are being incentivized to invest more in MEV extraction. In summary, Prof. Luyao Zhang describes how the research advances Prof. Tim Roughgarden\u2019s theoretical research from the following three aspects: The empirical analysis of the transaction fee in this research shows that there is not much reduction on the gas fee level after London Fork, thus it serves as a counterpart of Prof Roughgarden\u2019s theoretical work on confirming that EIP-1559 is not a solution for scalability. The empirical analysis of waiting time is actually a pure exploration and pioneer study since there is no systematic theoretical research before. The empirical analysis of consensus security in this research focuses on different aspects compared to Prof Roughgarden\u2019s work besides the methodology differences. Figure 6: Contribution Map (Source: Copyright@Fan Zhang and Luyao Zhang 2022 ) More about the paper This research also leaves plenty of interesting future research directions. It inspires more computer scientists and economists to collaborate on cutting-edge interdisciplinary research to solve the issues in the Ethereum blockchain through mechanism design, which comprises both profound insights and practical impacts. Notably, the research pioneers a research agenda that applies the method of natural experiments [6], the Nobel Prize 2021 in Economics which mitigates the internal validity problem in the lab experiments and external validity problem in the field experiments , to conduct empirical studies of mechanism changes on Ethereum. Prof. Luyao Zhang concludes with three main advantages to explain why Ethereum blockchain data makes the empirical study with natural experiments more approachable: First, blockchain data is well recorded and transparent to free the researchers from the data availability issue; Second, all the users\u2019 privacy is well protected in order to discord the ethics issue thanks to advanced asymmetric cryptography; Third, smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain enables an automation process to significantly reduce the data collection costs. Figure 7: Methodologies (Source: Copyright@Fan Zhang and Luyao Zhang 2022 ) Second, it inspires future researchers to think about how to use a theoretical framework to rigorously describe the reason for the empirical result that the waiting time significantly decreased after London Fork. Moreover, mempool data is another important and exciting source to analyze in-depth in order to better understand blockchains in various ways. Prof. Fan Zhang also mentions in the presentation that his team is now working with Ethereum Foundation under its sponsorship on a project to dig deeper into mempool data to understand blockchains in various aspects. Personal Reflections After watching this presentation, I am extremely inspired by how interdisciplinary collaborations can provide cutting-edge research with both profound insights and practical impacts, which is obviously not possible only by scholars from one discipline. For example, without Prof Luyao Zhang\u2019s contribution of her expertise on the natural experiment methodology and her solid knowledge in bounded rationality and mechanism design ( Levin and Zhang 2017 ; Levin and Zhang 2020 ), I couldn\u2019t imagine how open-source data on Ethereum blockchain would ever empower causal inferences in the study of bounded rationality and mechanism design. In the meanwhile, if we did not have the mempool data collected across the globe by Prof. Fan Zhang as well as his sharp insights on the waiting time estimation corrected by a subtle but super smart trick, we would not ever be able to evaluate the effect of EIP-1559 on waiting time, one important aspect of user experience empirically. Their joint insights from economics and computer science provide us with such an intellectual feast; neither side is dispensable. Moreover, I also admire how scholars, during the pandemic, can really turn the adversity in background, disciplines, and time zone differences into an opportunity for innovation. This innovation is indeed really hard to implement since it takes time to ensure that scholars, including two other co-authors Prof. Yulin Liu and Prof. Kartik Nayak , whose expertise are in economics and computer science and whose primary employments are in industry and academia respectively, from different backgrounds are on the same page. The impossibility of in-person interactions and time zone differences further aggregate the difficulty. I believe it is their empathy, compassion, and intrinsic motivation in interdisciplinary research and innovation that makes it possible for us to see the new frontiers of human civilizations. As Prof. Luyao Zhang always reminds her students that the Master once said: Virtue is not left to be alone; he who practices it finds neighbors. Last but not least, I also notice that this research team includes not only junior professors, but also some undergraduate students. I am deeply touched by the junior professors\u2019 visions in not only pioneering seminal research at the frontier of human civilizations but also cultivating undergraduate research that would benefit generations to come. Their scholarship encourages more and more young scholars not to seek near but distant objectives and devote themselves to seminal research that could further advance the development of humanity. I am also fortunate to be one of those students accessible to research from my undergraduate years at Duke Kunshan University [7]. I feel such a privilege to be invited by Prof. Fan Zhang and Prof. Luyao Zhang to serve as the student project manager for their joint project entitled \u201cUnderstanding the transaction fee mechanism of Ethereum blockchain,\u201d supported by Ethereum Academic Grant 2022. How can I find a better way to spend the Summer? Last but not least, the intellectual conversations remind me of my motto from a famous philosopher, Immanuel Kant\u200b: Ich bin von heute und ehedem, aber etwas ist in mir, das ist vor morgen und \u00fcbermorgen und einstmals! English Translation: I belong to today and the past, but some of my things will belong to tomorrow, the day after and the future! Inspired by this motto, I feel more motivated to contribute to interdisciplinary research in the future and bring a real impact to human society.

Rollups are designed to perform transaction execution outside layer 1 but it enables the data to be posted to layer 1 where consensus is reached. As transaction data is included in layer 1 blocks, this allows rollups to be secured by native Ethereum security.

At the same time, as empirical data shows that MEV is becoming a larger share of the revenue from miners\u2019 point of view, researchers conjecture that miners are being incentivized to invest more in MEV extraction. In summary, Prof. Luyao Zhang describes how the research advances Prof. Tim Roughgarden\u2019s theoretical research from the following three aspects: The empirical analysis of the transaction fee in this research shows that there is not much reduction on the gas fee level after London Fork, thus it serves as a counterpart of Prof Roughgarden\u2019s theoretical work on confirming that EIP-1559 is not a solution for scalability. The empirical analysis of waiting time is actually a pure exploration and pioneer study since there is no systematic theoretical research before. The empirical analysis of consensus security in this research focuses on different aspects compared to Prof Roughgarden\u2019s work besides the methodology differences.

It inspires more computer scientists and economists to collaborate on cutting-edge interdisciplinary research to solve the issues in the Ethereum blockchain through mechanism design, which comprises both profound insights and practical impacts. Notably, the research pioneers a research agenda that applies the method of natural experiments [6], the Nobel Prize 2021 in Economics which mitigates the internal validity problem in the lab experiments and external validity problem in the field experiments , to conduct empirical studies of mechanism changes on Ethereum. Prof. Luyao Zhang concludes with three main advantages to explain why Ethereum blockchain data makes the empirical study with natural experiments more approachable: First, blockchain data is well recorded and transparent to free the researchers from the data availability issue; Second, all the users\u2019 privacy is well protected in order to discord the ethics issue thanks to advanced asymmetric cryptography; Third, smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain enables an automation process to significantly reduce the data collection costs. Figure 7: Methodologies (Source: Copyright@Fan Zhang and Luyao Zhang 2022 ) Second, it inspires future researchers to think about how to use a theoretical framework to rigorously describe the reason for the empirical result that the waiting time significantly decreased after London Fork. Moreover, mempool data is another important and exciting source to analyze in-depth in order to better understand blockchains in various ways. Prof. Fan Zhang also mentions in the presentation that his team is now working with Ethereum Foundation under its sponsorship on a project to dig deeper into mempool data to understand blockchains in various aspects.","title":"More about the paper"},{"location":"articles/Innovate/RecapofETHconomics%40Devconnect2022/#personal-reflections","text":"After watching this presentation, I am extremely inspired by how interdisciplinary collaborations can provide cutting-edge research with both profound insights and practical impacts, which is obviously not possible only by scholars from one discipline. For example, without Prof Luyao Zhang\u2019s contribution of her expertise on the natural experiment methodology and her solid knowledge in bounded rationality and mechanism design ( Levin and Zhang 2017 ; Levin and Zhang 2020 ), I couldn\u2019t imagine how open-source data on Ethereum blockchain would ever empower causal inferences in the study of bounded rationality and mechanism design. In the meanwhile, if we did not have the mempool data collected across the globe by Prof. Fan Zhang as well as his sharp insights on the waiting time estimation corrected by a subtle but super smart trick, we would not ever be able to evaluate the effect of EIP-1559 on waiting time, one important aspect of user experience empirically. Their joint insights from economics and computer science provide us with such an intellectual feast; neither side is dispensable. Moreover, I also admire how scholars, during the pandemic, can really turn the adversity in background, disciplines, and time zone differences into an opportunity for innovation. This innovation is indeed really hard to implement since it takes time to ensure that scholars, including two other co-authors Prof. Yulin Liu and Prof. Kartik Nayak , whose expertise are in economics and computer science and whose primary employments are in industry and academia respectively, from different backgrounds are on the same page. The impossibility of in-person interactions and time zone differences further aggregate the difficulty. I believe it is their empathy, compassion, and intrinsic motivation in interdisciplinary research and innovation that makes it possible for us to see the new frontiers of human civilizations. As Prof. Luyao Zhang always reminds her students that the Master once said: Virtue is not left to be alone; he who practices it finds neighbors. Last but not least, I also notice that this research team includes not only junior professors, but also some undergraduate students. I am deeply touched by the junior professors\u2019 visions in not only pioneering seminal research at the frontier of human civilizations but also cultivating undergraduate research that would benefit generations to come. Their scholarship encourages more and more young scholars not to seek near but distant objectives and devote themselves to seminal research that could further advance the development of humanity. I am also fortunate to be one of those students accessible to research from my undergraduate years at Duke Kunshan University [7]. I feel such a privilege to be invited by Prof. Fan Zhang and Prof. Luyao Zhang to serve as the student project manager for their joint project entitled \u201cUnderstanding the transaction fee mechanism of Ethereum blockchain,\u201d supported by Ethereum Academic Grant 2022. How can I find a better way to spend the Summer? Last but not least, the intellectual conversations remind me of my motto from a famous philosopher, Immanuel Kant\u200b: Ich bin von heute und ehedem, aber etwas ist in mir, das ist vor morgen und \u00fcbermorgen und einstmals! English Translation: I belong to today and the past, but some of my things will belong to tomorrow, the day after and the future! Inspired by this motto, I feel more motivated to contribute to interdisciplinary research in the future and bring a real impact to human society.","title":"Personal Reflections"},{"location":"articles/Innovate/RecapofETHconomics%40Devconnect2022/#relevant-materials","text":"[1] ACM CCS\u201922 The ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security (CCS) is the flagship annual conference of the Special Interest Group on Security, Audit and Control (SIGSAC) of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM).

The current picture of the Metaverse was mostly created by the leading centralized enterprises, like Facebook , Microsoft , and Google , with high-tech products in game design, wearable devices, and social media platforms. However, considering the public trust issues and potential collapse in centralized institutions, we argue that only with decentralization can the Metaverse be brought to reality. In this article, we first analyze the current architecture of Metaverse in the centralized world and then discuss the importance of decentralization, with the problems we find in reality. We use a case study at the end of this article to demonstrate how its functionality fits the idea of Metaverse and how it can be improved with decentralized systems. What is Metaverse? As the CEO of Facebook, Mr. Mark Zukerberg announced to his employees earlier this year that \u201cWhat I think is most interesting is how these themes (communities, creators, commerce, and virtual reality) will come together into a bigger idea. Our overarching goal across all of these initiatives is to help bring the metaverse to life.\u201d The idea of Metaverse, which indicates an avant-garde stage of augmented reality that integrates human community, ecosystems, and high-tech development, has caught people\u2019s attention. Promoted by the great pandemic of COVID-19, the importance of social media and online platforms has been magnified with people\u2019s realization of the indispensability of communication and economic activities. The idea of the Metaverse then jumped out, saying what if human beings can be supported on any online platform one day? This idea proposes a sci-fi-like future stage where people are living frictionlessly in both the digital virtual world and reality. And the implementation can be supported by any mobile terminal. Nowadays, many industrial pioneers are building approaches with high-tech development. How does Metaverse be implemented and applied? Figure 1: Several current projects supporting Metaverse (created by Whimsical). The current picture of the Metaverse is discrete. Many leading enterprises are developing VR / AR / MR technologies or applying the idea of partial metaverse to their products. The projects can be constructed into four categories: Games, Devices/Hardware, Social media, and decentralized technologies. The Online Games: An Immersive environment Figure 2: MMORPG Online Games are the most mature applications that have elements of the Metaverse. Online games are comprehensive platforms that enable the following characters. (1) Users are able to have virtual identities or avatars. Compared with reality, online games provide opportunities for people to hide their real identities and use digital avatars to represent themselves. The concealment of participants\u2019 identities promotes trust-building in the large social network and promotes personal data-preserving. Figure 3: Cross-Platform Game (2) Cross-platform experiences. The globalization of human culture and data sharing requires high, capable cross-platform applications. Some of the online games are accessible to many platforms like smartphones, Switch , desktop computers, and game consoles . (3) Users can build their own communities for socialization. Also, some games have fixed or open business models for financial usage. 2. The Devices/Hardware: The hardware is currently wearable devices like glasses. They have evolved from simple 3D glasses to MR (mixed reality) glasses which support reflecting virtual stuff into reality. For example, Microsoft HoloLens supports the interaction between virtual reality and the real world by gestures and voices. For example, people can pick up a virtual item with real actions in a real environment by wearing a pair of them. 3. The Social Media Instead of communication with real identities, the social media in the Metaverse allow users to create and customize avatars for communication. They are able to hide their real identities, and virtual communication is one of the essential elements of the Metaverse. 4. Decentralized Technologies Although the current architecture for the realization of the Metaverse seems to be concrete, we argue that only with decentralized technologies and distributed systems can the world finally reach the successor of the Metaverse. The limitations of the traditional centralized industrial architectures are obvious: the risks of privacy-preserving and the information collapse with data loss problem. Under the scenario that users\u2019 information is collected with the central institution, the development of the centralized market will be limited with the trust problem. The decentralized technologies, which utilize the architecture of the distributed networking system, have supported the construction of FinTech with various kinds of decentralized applications (DApps), new trading modes, and assets authentications. With its distributed ledger system and the open-source networking, the trust problem would be easily dealt with in the algorithm operation. Technical System Why is it so important to have decentralization: DApp? People keep doubting the concept of \u201cdecentralization\u201d: why do we really need it? Is decentralization necessarily good? Do we need to decentralize everything? In the Internet sector, these questions are even more pronounced. With the development of blockchain technology, the Internet is going through a \u201cdecentralization frenzy\u201d. Every day, whether necessary or not, new and exciting DApps are being released on the Internet. But do these apps really need decentralization and what on earth are the reasons why we need DApps? The reasons why we need DApps can be summed up in two simple words: trust and risk . A platform you can trust \u201cTrust\u201d plays an essential role in almost all applications because it is closely related to two perspectives: the accessibility of the user profile and the administration of user assets. The loss of trust in a centralized world may represent the loss of accessibility of personal identity in the digital world. When you use a password to manage your personal account in an application, the loss of your password may deny your personal identity online. And you need to trust the company that developed the app to keep your passwords safe from being leaked or used for other commercial purposes. The failure in trust may also represent the loss of administration of your personal assets. You open an account with a bank to deposit money based on your trust in the bank\u2019s credibility, but an accidental bankruptcy may destroy the security of a large part of your property. This is where decentralized technology comes into play. A decentralized system, or app, is usually transparent and open. All operations made by the platform are executed according to clear rules, and any transactions on the platform are confirmed by all users. Unlike centralized applications, there is no single \u201cadministrator\u201d with absolute power on a decentralized platform. Ideally, when you deposit your entire savings into a decentralized bank, you don\u2019t have to worry about the platform misappropriation or embezzling your funds at will, or the platform administrator running away, as long as you keep your account address safe. A platform with little collapse risk The second important metric for applications or platforms is risk. The potential risk may exist in the collapse of a platform. Let\u2019s go back to the example of banks. The biggest potential risk that a user will bear for any platform is the closure or collapse of the platform. The collapse of a platform means that the user will lose all assets and rights on that platform, relationships, information, etc. This is nothing but catastrophic for large applications such as social networks or asset management platforms. At the level of platform collapse risk, decentralized platforms represent an unparalleled advantage compared to centralized platforms. Due to their decentralized nature, they are more tolerant of single or partial node crashes, and only a majority of nodes across the network crashing simultaneously will put the platform at risk of collapse, which has a very low probability of happening. Case Study: EVE Online Although giant companies nowadays always keep talking about making the Metaverse a reality, it is still hard to find a single platform or a game that satisfies people\u2019s expectation of a true \u201cMetaverse\u201d. However, it is still possible to find a good \u201cmimic\u201d of a Metaverse \u2014 introducing the EVE Online . Overview Figure 4: EVE Online EVE Online is not a very popular game compared to Fortnite . EVE Online was released in North America and Europe in May 2003 and is a space-based, persistent world MMORPG developed and published by CCP Games . Currently, EVE online is operated by CCP Games and runs on centralized servers located in Europe. Although there is nearly no supportive literature, I think EVE Online is one of the first games with the most comprehensive Metaverse features, providing players a great degree of freedom. A Comprehensive Economic System The economic system in EVE Online is close to the free market in reality. There are different \u201cgalaxies\u201d in EVE, and most of them have independent \u201cmarket\u201d space stations for trading. In the marketplace, players can trade items through an order book . The division of labor in the game is sophisticated. There are players who specialize in manufacturing or commerce in the game, some focus on obtaining raw materials from the NPC, some produce primary or secondary products from raw materials, and some buy products at low prices and sell them at higher prices in other places, and more. Besides, prices of all items in the market are not determined by the system, but by the price mechanism . The freedom of the economic system also causes problems of monopoly , that is, there are groups in the market that take advantage of low prices to monopolize the sales of a certain item. Figure 5: Market in EVE EVE Online and the Real World The game publisher did not link the game with the real world publicly. However, within the player community, the in-game currency, ISK, tends to have a relatively stable exchange rate with the fiat currency. Players can pay money in the real world on some unofficial platforms to buy game coins, which have given rise to players and even companies that specialize in making a living from playing EVE Online. These companies use powerful management systems to plan the production and sale of in-game resources and information advantages to earn large amounts of in-game currency and convert it to fiat currency. Still a Long Way to Metaverse One thing to notice is that EVE Online wasn\u2019t designed to be a Metaverse. The game\u2019s more than a decade of operation and the extremely loyal player base has allowed it to develop its characteristics as a Metaverse game. Over time, the primary rules by which EVE Online operates have shifted from rules set by the game itself, such as quests provided by NPCs, to \u201cunspoken rules\u201d developed by the player community itself. What Makes EVE Online Like a Metaverse? Like what people expect a Metaverse to have, EVE Online does not limit the player\u2019s action. The game allows players to develop their own gameplay as long as there is a consensus among player communities. For example, the diplomatic system in EVE Online. In the basic rules of the game, if a corp is defeated, the victorious have the right to claim territories of the defeated. However, in the actual gameplay, sometimes both sides will usually send diplomats to negotiate and determine some other terms instead of a simple territorial distribution. This level of freedom has allowed EVE Online to develop so many Metaverse features today. And What Does Not? Although EVE Online has many innovative features, there is still a huge gap between it and a real Metaverse. To get closer to the Metaverse, the EVE Online still has to overcome many limitations. EVE Online is being operated by a single company and running on centralized servers. This means that the operator has absolute control over the user data and other information within the game. And, unlike the current blockchain-based games, operators can change the rules and content of the game at will. Unlike blockchain, in terms of trust-building, EVE Online relies heavily on the reputation of the game operator, rather than on the nature of the game rules themself. Therefore, if one wants to create similar games on the blockchain, the establishment of high-efficiency trust mechanisms will be one of the most engineered parts. Another huge difference between EVE Online and blockchain-based games is its currency mechanism. The currency in EVE Online is just a virtual number, and the transaction of goods is essentially a direct change to the user\u2019s wallet information, without the so-called \u201ctransaction\u201d process. This leads to potential property security risks. A blockchain-based transaction system is necessary if we want to build the Metaverse in the future, using EVE Online as a blueprint. Potentials However, with many of today\u2019s new technologies, especially those regarding decentralization, the EVE Online still has a lot of room for improvement, bringing it closer to a full Metaverse. First, decentralized technology is one of the excellent solutions to the trust problem. As mentioned before, if there are administrators with absolute power on a platform, the users\u2019 trust will cause a problem when the volume of the platform reaches a certain level, preventing users from investing more of their resources, limiting the platform\u2019s continued expansion. If the entire platform were to be decentralized, this would re-establish users\u2019 trust in EVE Online and make them feel more comfortable investing a larger part of their lives on the platform. Along with the introduction of decentralization, many of today\u2019s blockchain technologies were also able to be brought in. One possible improvement is to integrate the NFT system. The integration of NFT will further bring the in-game economic system closer to the real one, further stimulating the market.

The current picture of the Metaverse was mostly created by the leading centralized enterprises, like Facebook , Microsoft , and Google , with high-tech products in game design, wearable devices, and social media platforms. However, considering the public trust issues and potential collapse in centralized institutions, we argue that only with decentralization can the Metaverse be brought to reality. In this article, we first analyze the current architecture of Metaverse in the centralized world and then discuss the importance of decentralization, with the problems we find in reality. We use a case study at the end of this article to demonstrate how its functionality fits the idea of Metaverse and how it can be improved with decentralized systems.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"articles/Research/AGlanceintotheMetaverse/#what-is-metaverse","text":"As the CEO of Facebook, Mr. Mark Zukerberg announced to his employees earlier this year that \u201cWhat I think is most interesting is how these themes (communities, creators, commerce, and virtual reality) will come together into a bigger idea. Our overarching goal across all of these initiatives is to help bring the metaverse to life.\u201d The idea of Metaverse, which indicates an avant-garde stage of augmented reality that integrates human community, ecosystems, and high-tech development, has caught people\u2019s attention. Promoted by the great pandemic of COVID-19, the importance of social media and online platforms has been magnified with people\u2019s realization of the indispensability of communication and economic activities. The idea of the Metaverse then jumped out, saying what if human beings can be supported on any online platform one day? This idea proposes a sci-fi-like future stage where people are living frictionlessly in both the digital virtual world and reality. And the implementation can be supported by any mobile terminal. Nowadays, many industrial pioneers are building approaches with high-tech development.","title":"What is Metaverse?"},{"location":"articles/Research/AGlanceintotheMetaverse/#how-does-metaverse-be-implemented-and-applied","text":"Figure 1: Several current projects supporting Metaverse (created by Whimsical). The current picture of the Metaverse is discrete. Many leading enterprises are developing VR / AR / MR technologies or applying the idea of partial metaverse to their products. The projects can be constructed into four categories: Games, Devices/Hardware, Social media, and decentralized technologies. The Online Games: An Immersive environment Figure 2: MMORPG Online Games are the most mature applications that have elements of the Metaverse. Online games are comprehensive platforms that enable the following characters. (1) Users are able to have virtual identities or avatars. Compared with reality, online games provide opportunities for people to hide their real identities and use digital avatars to represent themselves. The concealment of participants\u2019 identities promotes trust-building in the large social network and promotes personal data-preserving. Figure 3: Cross-Platform Game (2) Cross-platform experiences. The globalization of human culture and data sharing requires high, capable cross-platform applications. Some of the online games are accessible to many platforms like smartphones, Switch , desktop computers, and game consoles . (3) Users can build their own communities for socialization. Also, some games have fixed or open business models for financial usage. 2. The Devices/Hardware: The hardware is currently wearable devices like glasses. They have evolved from simple 3D glasses to MR (mixed reality) glasses which support reflecting virtual stuff into reality. For example, Microsoft HoloLens supports the interaction between virtual reality and the real world by gestures and voices. For example, people can pick up a virtual item with real actions in a real environment by wearing a pair of them. 3. The Social Media Instead of communication with real identities, the social media in the Metaverse allow users to create and customize avatars for communication. They are able to hide their real identities, and virtual communication is one of the essential elements of the Metaverse. 4. Decentralized Technologies Although the current architecture for the realization of the Metaverse seems to be concrete, we argue that only with decentralized technologies and distributed systems can the world finally reach the successor of the Metaverse. The limitations of the traditional centralized industrial architectures are obvious: the risks of privacy-preserving and the information collapse with data loss problem. Under the scenario that users\u2019 information is collected with the central institution, the development of the centralized market will be limited with the trust problem. The decentralized technologies, which utilize the architecture of the distributed networking system, have supported the construction of FinTech with various kinds of decentralized applications (DApps), new trading modes, and assets authentications. With its distributed ledger system and the open-source networking, the trust problem would be easily dealt with in the algorithm operation.","title":"How does Metaverse be implemented and applied?"},{"location":"articles/Research/AGlanceintotheMetaverse/#technical-system","text":"","title":"Technical System"},{"location":"articles/Research/AGlanceintotheMetaverse/#why-is-it-so-important-to-have-decentralization-dapp","text":"People keep doubting the concept of \u201cdecentralization\u201d: why do we really need it? Is decentralization necessarily good? Do we need to decentralize everything? In the Internet sector, these questions are even more pronounced. With the development of blockchain technology, the Internet is going through a \u201cdecentralization frenzy\u201d. Every day, whether necessary or not, new and exciting DApps are being released on the Internet. But do these apps really need decentralization and what on earth are the reasons why we need DApps? The reasons why we need DApps can be summed up in two simple words: trust and risk . A platform you can trust \u201cTrust\u201d plays an essential role in almost all applications because it is closely related to two perspectives: the accessibility of the user profile and the administration of user assets. The loss of trust in a centralized world may represent the loss of accessibility of personal identity in the digital world. When you use a password to manage your personal account in an application, the loss of your password may deny your personal identity online. And you need to trust the company that developed the app to keep your passwords safe from being leaked or used for other commercial purposes. The failure in trust may also represent the loss of administration of your personal assets. You open an account with a bank to deposit money based on your trust in the bank\u2019s credibility, but an accidental bankruptcy may destroy the security of a large part of your property. This is where decentralized technology comes into play. A decentralized system, or app, is usually transparent and open. All operations made by the platform are executed according to clear rules, and any transactions on the platform are confirmed by all users. Unlike centralized applications, there is no single \u201cadministrator\u201d with absolute power on a decentralized platform. Ideally, when you deposit your entire savings into a decentralized bank, you don\u2019t have to worry about the platform misappropriation or embezzling your funds at will, or the platform administrator running away, as long as you keep your account address safe. A platform with little collapse risk The second important metric for applications or platforms is risk. The potential risk may exist in the collapse of a platform. Let\u2019s go back to the example of banks. The biggest potential risk that a user will bear for any platform is the closure or collapse of the platform. The collapse of a platform means that the user will lose all assets and rights on that platform, relationships, information, etc. This is nothing but catastrophic for large applications such as social networks or asset management platforms. At the level of platform collapse risk, decentralized platforms represent an unparalleled advantage compared to centralized platforms.

In each algorithm, developers assistant managers to make the portfolio of crypto assets, aiming at high return for investors through transactions and investments. Let\u2019s prosper together in the merging ecosystem! Table 1: Ranking of Return of Various Algorithms in Crypto Investment Introduction In designing algorithms for crypto investments, three platforms, Set Protocol , Enzyme , dHEDGE , stand out in the industry. The functionalities of these three platforms are almost similar to the Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) in the traditional stock market. It allows clients with different demands to serve as roles including investors, managers, and developers. They altogether build an ecological world for cryptocurrency investment. In the following part, we will mainly take typical TokenSets in the Set Protocol as examples and describe its mechanisms, to better understand how people can utilize the technology to better manage their assets. The Ecosystem Mechanism How can different types of people operate on Set Protocol? In TokenSets, a product for portfolio management from Sets, customers can create their own \u201cSet\u201d or trade their Sets with different strategies. As described in the white paper , Set is \u201can abstract, fungible token fully collateralized by its underlying tokens\u201d. And with its composite tokens, Set makes it possible to reduce transaction fees for ERC20 tokens, focus on higher-level concepts (i.e., multiple layers building), promote the minting value with the underlying tokens, and avoid counterparty risks. For customization, users can switch their roles between investors, managers, and developers on their own: Table 2: Comparison between three roles in Set Protocol How can Sets operate to benefit customers? Figure 1: Set Protocol\u2019s operations for customers with different characters Structured Products: Index Token/ETF Several crypto indices have been created in Set to meet the market needs or niche. As a basket of tokens, Sets take advantage of the integration of the underlying tokens and reduction of cross-protocol operation costs that benefit all the stake-holders , including investors , managers , and developers . For investors , the Set offers lower transaction costs, diverse assets, lower maintenance requests, and easier tracking tools. In traditional investment, customers have to purchase several individual tokens and pay high trading fees for makers and transaction fees for network operations. And the active trading of their assets is a time-consuming action. With the comprehension of tokens, Sets can work as a unit in exchange platforms that literally users only purchase on one token. And with the fluctuation of the underlying tokens, users only need to rebalance the Sets with the updated ones or issue a Rebalancing Set . Users can lower the trading risks with Set issuance and redemption or trading for other Sets. For managers and developers , Sets are similar to Exchange-traded-funds that support creation and redemptions. However, compared with the traditional ETFs, traders can serve as the liquidity providers to normalize the Set price deviation, preventing the large deltas between the Set price and the Set\u2019s aggregate component value. 2. Long/Short Set Sets can also be classified into long or short Sets. In the long Set, an R-Token Security Token is applied through a smart contract to guarantee compliance when to accord to the appropriate regulatory bodies and with the requirements written by the initial issuer. In addition, a dYdX token is used in the short Sets, to provide traders with a simple way to get short and leveraged long exposure to crypto-assets. The combination of both a long and margin set is beneficial for the investors to identify the strategies in both long and short terms, in order to maximize the return of investment. 3. Multi-Token Use Case The Sets are combinations of tokens, which are efficient in comprehensive investment, market-making, and other advanced derivatives. And the Sets can be a good fit for representative units in the market demand of synthetic assets and combined tokens. Since decentralized applications (dApps) take the advantage of multiple protocols and require different tokens, the Sets are well-fitted in composite work. It benefits the developers in programs to call cross-protocol functions between smart contracts and decentralized exchange platforms. And besides dApps, there are more crypto-native use cases for Sets that are yet to be found. Some of the listed are Composite StableCoin, Protocol Collateral, Hedged Bet , and Fractional Ownership of Non-Fungible Assets . 4. Issuance and Redemption In the traditional financial market, investors cannot make their efforts to change the token supply, however, it is applicable to both issues and redeems the tokens. Specifically, issuing a token is to mint new tokens for a particular Set. It is a two-step process, including depositing funds into the Vault and then issuing, to put it another way, it means firstly attributing components to the Set and then minting a Set token to the user. Users can incrementally deposit tokens into their vault before issuing, as issuance uses a combination of the user\u2019s tokens in their wallet as well as their tokens in the Vault. With a valid deployed Set, anybody can convert a specified mix of ERC20 tokens into a Set token. On the contrary, Redemption is the process of converting a Set into its underlying component tokens. Redeeming tokens reduces the token supply of Set tokens in the contract. It involves burning a Set token and attributing the components to the end-user. And specifically for developers, Set provides several issuance and redemption functions, including BasicIssuanceModule , NAVIssuanceModule , and DebtIssuanceModule , which differ in positions of the issued SetTokens. Case Studies In order to help clients better understand the different Sets in all the portfolios, we here take two typical examples since those who have no experience in crypto investment are quite unfamiliar with these different strategies. Smart contracts are initially built in those cryptocurrencies, however, due to the lack of professional knowledge in code construction, people may not clearly comprehend the exact idea of portfolios. Thus, here we use plain words and connect some terms in the traditional world for an easier understanding. Figure 2: Investor Decision Tree For Set Protocol Case Study 1: DeFi Pulse Index From the Set Protocol platform, there is a DeFi Pulse Index in the Set, serving as a capitalization-weighted index that tracks the performance of decentralized financial assets within the DeFi industry, through holding a wider selection of tokens. The index is weighted based on the value of each token\u2019s circulating supply and aims to track projects in Decentralized Finance that have significant usage and show a commitment to ongoing maintenance and development. This actually creates a diversified portfolio, which always behaves less volatile and could obtain downside protection, compared to some concentrated portfolios. In addition, the use of market capitalization for component weights would prevent the investors from suffering underperformance due to some impermanent loss. For a newcomer in the DeFi industry, the DeFi Pulse Index is actually a blockchain financial product that lowers the barrier to entry for new users who lack the expertise to gain exposure to DeFi and provides experienced users with exposure to DeFi through one single asset. Case Study 2: The Quant Another example is called \u201cThe Quant\u201d , where it leverages machine learning and regression analysis to generate signals to automatically rebalance between Bitcoin and a Stablecoin. This portfolio is constructed in partnership with a leading multi-strategy cryptocurrency hedge fund for institutional investors. It is not hard to see that this strategy aims at a higher return of investment. According to the description of its rebalance strategy, it shows that it is devoted to capturing more than 80% of Bitcoin\u2019s returns while effectively improving risk versus long positions by exiting in downward trending markets. This strategy is completely different from that above, which shows a distinctive difference in the selection of investment strategy for investors in particular, and here we offer a lucid chart for those with different backgrounds to select a more suitable strategy in DeFi investment. Conclusion In this article, we take Set Protocol as an example to identify existing algorithms used in the real crypto investment world. Compared to Enzyme and dHEDGE, Set Protocol has a more user-friendly interface for digital asset management that enables ordinary users to access a wide range of financial instruments and products. But dHEDGE also brings new ways of using liquidity in the derivatives market, and Enzyme is currently integrated with the most decentralized exchange protocols as Oasis , Kyber Network , 0x , and Uniswap . However, there are no scholars systematically evaluating the return and risk, Sharpe Ratio, or Return of Investment (RoI) in these portfolios, and this implies that our further research would primarily focus on the evaluation of different portfolio management in the crypto investment, including asset classes, a hedged set, a composite set of stablecoins, etc. Since this is quite a new topic and we have identified a great number of interesting research opportunities and potential strategies for ecosystem stakeholders. Thus we draft this medium article as a starting point to inspire seminal research and applications.

For customization, users can switch their roles between investors, managers, and developers on their own: Table 2: Comparison between three roles in Set Protocol","title":"How can different types of people operate on Set Protocol?"},{"location":"articles/Research/AlgorithmicTradinginCryptoMarket/#how-can-sets-operate-to-benefit-customers","text":"Figure 1: Set Protocol\u2019s operations for customers with different characters Structured Products: Index Token/ETF Several crypto indices have been created in Set to meet the market needs or niche. As a basket of tokens, Sets take advantage of the integration of the underlying tokens and reduction of cross-protocol operation costs that benefit all the stake-holders , including investors , managers , and developers . For investors , the Set offers lower transaction costs, diverse assets, lower maintenance requests, and easier tracking tools. In traditional investment, customers have to purchase several individual tokens and pay high trading fees for makers and transaction fees for network operations. And the active trading of their assets is a time-consuming action. With the comprehension of tokens, Sets can work as a unit in exchange platforms that literally users only purchase on one token. And with the fluctuation of the underlying tokens, users only need to rebalance the Sets with the updated ones or issue a Rebalancing Set . Users can lower the trading risks with Set issuance and redemption or trading for other Sets. For managers and developers , Sets are similar to Exchange-traded-funds that support creation and redemptions. However, compared with the traditional ETFs, traders can serve as the liquidity providers to normalize the Set price deviation, preventing the large deltas between the Set price and the Set\u2019s aggregate component value. 2. Long/Short Set Sets can also be classified into long or short Sets. In the long Set, an R-Token Security Token is applied through a smart contract to guarantee compliance when to accord to the appropriate regulatory bodies and with the requirements written by the initial issuer. In addition, a dYdX token is used in the short Sets, to provide traders with a simple way to get short and leveraged long exposure to crypto-assets. The combination of both a long and margin set is beneficial for the investors to identify the strategies in both long and short terms, in order to maximize the return of investment. 3. Multi-Token Use Case The Sets are combinations of tokens, which are efficient in comprehensive investment, market-making, and other advanced derivatives. And the Sets can be a good fit for representative units in the market demand of synthetic assets and combined tokens. Since decentralized applications (dApps) take the advantage of multiple protocols and require different tokens, the Sets are well-fitted in composite work. It benefits the developers in programs to call cross-protocol functions between smart contracts and decentralized exchange platforms. And besides dApps, there are more crypto-native use cases for Sets that are yet to be found. Some of the listed are Composite StableCoin, Protocol Collateral, Hedged Bet , and Fractional Ownership of Non-Fungible Assets . 4. Issuance and Redemption In the traditional financial market, investors cannot make their efforts to change the token supply, however, it is applicable to both issues and redeems the tokens. Specifically, issuing a token is to mint new tokens for a particular Set. It is a two-step process, including depositing funds into the Vault and then issuing, to put it another way, it means firstly attributing components to the Set and then minting a Set token to the user. Users can incrementally deposit tokens into their vault before issuing, as issuance uses a combination of the user\u2019s tokens in their wallet as well as their tokens in the Vault. With a valid deployed Set, anybody can convert a specified mix of ERC20 tokens into a Set token. On the contrary, Redemption is the process of converting a Set into its underlying component tokens. Redeeming tokens reduces the token supply of Set tokens in the contract. It involves burning a Set token and attributing the components to the end-user. And specifically for developers, Set provides several issuance and redemption functions, including BasicIssuanceModule , NAVIssuanceModule , and DebtIssuanceModule , which differ in positions of the issued SetTokens.","title":"How can Sets operate to benefit customers?"},{"location":"articles/Research/AlgorithmicTradinginCryptoMarket/#case-studies","text":"In order to help clients better understand the different Sets in all the portfolios, we here take two typical examples since those who have no experience in crypto investment are quite unfamiliar with these different strategies.

This post first sheds light on the connections between traditional and blockchain governance, then discusses how blockchain and governance can be mutually empowering in creating a sustainable future. Figure 1: The School of Athens by Raphael Takeaways Traditional governance such as direct and representative democracy have an impact on shaping blockchain governance. There is no one superior form of governance. Each type of governance played to the strengths of its nation/system. Layers of blockchain governance mainly include on-chain and off-chain. Crucial dimensions of blockchain governance include incentives and decision making, etc. Governance is crucial for blockchain projects\u2019 sustainability. On-chain and off-chain governance have their own merits and flaws. Emerging technologies like blockchain could revolutionize governance for the better. Governance in blockchain, the private sector, and the public sector could together contribute to a sustainable future by making better and smarter decisions facilitated by technology. The tendency to form groups is at the root of human nature. We form tribes, families, and societies seeking to survive and thrive. With the establishment of these social systems comes the rules that organize actions and interactions, which fall into the name governance. The term \u201cgovernance\u201d comes from the ancient Greek \u201ckubern\u00e2n\u201d, used to refer to the steering of ships. It was Plato who used it to refer to the steering of the polis and human beings. Governance can affect an organization on both macro and micro levels. Therefore, an effective governance mechanism can often drive and sustain a group\u2019s development. Traditional Governance Governance vs. Government The terms governance and government sometimes get conflated, leading to a distortion of their roles. So it is worth clarifying their differences before our discussion on governance. Compared to the definition of governance stated above, the government is only one arm of modern society and it describes a more rigid and narrower set of activities among a narrower set of participants. In other words, the difference between government and governance is that government is only one part of the governance of managing our large and complex modern society. Typical Forms of Traditional Governance Since blockchain governance is largely evolved from the traditional models, it would be helpful to understand some of them before delving into the blockchain realm. Nonetheless, there are many governance systems, and in no way could this discussion be exhaustive. We will focus on the two forms of democracy that have widely influenced the blockchain governance models. In addition, there are some other interesting non-democratic governance regimes worth mentioning. We will introduce the following 7 governance types: Direct democracy Representative democracy Technocracy Plutocracy Theocracy Oligarchy Monarchy Direct Democracy Figure 2: Pericles Gives the Funeral Speech, by Philipp Foltz (1852) Originated from the ancient Greeks, democracy literally means \u201cruled by the people\u201d, and therefore its key is that people should have a voice. The first known democracy in the world was in Athens. Developed around the fifth century B.C.E., the Greek idea of democracy was different from present-day democracy as, in Athens, all adult citizens (free men) were required to take an active part in the government. Each year, 500 names were chosen from all the citizens of ancient Athens. Those 500 citizens had to actively serve in the government for one year. During that year, they were responsible for making new laws and controlling all parts of the political process. When a new law was proposed, all the citizens of Athens had the opportunity to vote on it. This form of governance is called direct democracy, meaning that all decisions have to be voted directly by the people, without an intermediary. Representative Democracy Figure 3: Cicerone denuncia Catilina (Roman Emperor addressing the senate), by Cesare Maccari (1888) Contrary to direct democracy, representative democracy means that only a selected few, chosen by the citizens, can vote for rules and decisions. Representative democracy also has a long history that dates back to ancient Rome. A more familiar example of representative democracy is the United States. U.S. citizens can vote for their government officials. These officials represent the citizens\u2019 ideas and concerns in government where they vote for laws that serve the interests of their citizens. Closely related to the notion of both representative and direct democracy is a relatively new model named liquid democracy. Liquid democracy essentially allows individuals to choose representatives who have expertise in certain areas and vote on their behalf. In other words, voters delegate their voting rights to their trusted proxy representatives. However, if the individuals think that the representatives voted incorrectly, that is the trust between the voter and the representative is broken, they can simply revoke the vote (Fretwell, 2019) . Liquid democracy, requiring the functionality to delegate and revoke a vote, is a relatively recent proposition that is made feasible by blockchain technology. Moreover, the voting power passes transitively from one individual to the next, leading to a directed network graph connecting every voter to experts and politicians. According to Harvard Technology Review, the transitivity characteristic of liquidity democracy \u201callows for a network of more meaningful connections, rewarding a community\u2019s most trusted leaders while simultaneously empowering citizens to participate in the democratic process\u201d (Lu-Romeo, 2021) . You can read more about liquid democracy and its importance to revitalize governance in this Harvard Technology Review post . Comparison Between Direct and Representative Democracy Like any kind of regime, there is no objectively superior form of democracy. Each system of governance played to the strengths of its nation . In Greece, the citizens were well-educated, and power was central to the capital, whereas the Roman empire was massive and very diverse in terms of language and culture. It would have been impossible to get the opinion of every citizen in a timely manner. Therefore, the governance developed by each empire also reflected the structure of their societies: direct democracy for Greek and representative democracy for Roman. The statements stand for blockchain governance as well. Below is a summary of the pros & cons of the two forms of democracy (Massessi, 2020) . Figure 4: Summary of pros and cons for direct and representative democracy (created by Whimsical) Technocracy As its name suggests, technocracy is a society controlled by an elite of experts as decision-makers, who are selected based on their scientific or technical expertise. More practically, a government in which elected officials appoint experts and professionals to administer individual government functions and recommend legislation can be considered technocratic. Technocracy may sound distant to mainstream governance types, but it was favored in the technocracy movement active in the United States and Canada in the 1930s. The technocracy movement arose in the midst of the Great Depression, which ushered in radically different ideas of social engineering (Wikipedia, 2019) . The advocates aimed to promote a society led by technical experts to tackle the inherent complexity of the economy. Ultimately, the movement was overshadowed by other proposals dealing with the Great Depression. Figure 5: The official symbol of the Technocracy movement (Technocracy Inc.), Wikipedia As we will discuss later in the article, off-chain governance is more similar to real-world politics since it is usually the group of people most familiar with the project (e.g., core developers) that have the most say in decision-making. Since off-chain governance relies more on human discretion, it poses a higher technical barrier for participants. Therefore, it is close to technocracy where the group of developers and community members with in-depth knowledge of the project control the majority of the decision-making power. Oligarchy and Plutocracy Oligarchy literally means \u201cfor a few to rule or command\u201d and is a power structure where a small group of people controls the decision-making power. Plutocracy means a society ruled by the wealthy. These two types of governance are discussed side by side because they both mean that the power is distributed to a minority of people. Therefore, plutocracy, ruled by the wealthy minority, can be viewed as part of oligarchy, ruled by the privileged minority. For instance, Iran is characterized as an Islamic clerical oligarchy since the clerics control much of the power structure (National Geographic, 2021) . Some historical examples of plutocracy include the Roman Empire, some city-states in Ancient Greece, the civilization of Carthage, and the Dutch Republic (Wikipedia, 2019) . Having a centralized group of decision-makers determined by their wealth can undermine the project. If plutocratic governance arises on a blockchain (typically on-chain governance), in the most generic sense, a large coin-holder could have large voting power. However, the problem naturally emerges when coin-holder and blockchain user interests are not naturally aligned. Vitalik Buterin, founder of Ethereum, among many others has also argued in his blog that \u201cplutocracy is still bad\u201d. Theocracy A rarer form of modern governance is a theocracy, where the system of government is ruled by priests in the name of a deity. While theocracy is typical of early civilizations, contemporary examples include Iran and Saudi Arabia, two Islamic theocratic countries. Monarchy Monarchy refers to a form of government in which a person, the monarch, is head of state for life or until abdication. A contemporary example would be Saudi Arabia. Blockchain Governance What is Blockchain Governance? A blockchain project is essentially a software repository where its source code specifies the implementation of the protocol. The protocol includes specifications such as how participants should be rewarded and how transactions are executed. To further develop the project, people involved in the blockchain project need to determine how updates should be made, and the process of updating the protocol should be coordinated. This is where blockchain governance is needed. As a distributed ledger, blockchain governance is inevitably different from traditional forms of governance. For example, it doesn\u2019t need any physical headquarters or CEO that oversees the project, but rather a network of developers for developing the protocol. This also poses a unique challenge: developers are responsible for implementing the code that distributes power amongst the blockchain stakeholders (Pelt et al. 2020) . In addition, whereas governments act as third parties between two actors trying to interact in society, one of the most celebrated characteristics of blockchain is the elimination of any intermediaries. This is analogous to the idea of \u201cgoverning without governments\u201d, which has implications on both blockchain and governance. Now, having a general idea of what blockchain is, we can examine blockchain governance through a systematic lens. Pelt et al. (2021) provide a comprehensive framework that allows comparison and analysis between governance frameworks. The proposed framework is supported by extensive literature and expert interviews. For simplicity, we include a concise summary of the components. 3 layers: On-chain and off-chain governance are the two main governance types for blockchain. As the name suggests, on-chain governance means that the decision-making process is embedded in the source code of the protocol. Off-chain governance, on the other hand, is similar to traditional forms of governance since the decision-making is less programmatic and more manual. Here, Pelt et al. (2020) further distinguish between off-chain community and development. We will discuss these two types in more detail in the later section. 6 dimensions: Roles : In any form of governance, different roles are accountable for different actions. In blockchain governance, roles may include a foundation, miners, and developers, etc. Incentives : Being able to incentivize different roles to contribute to the blockchain is crucial for the project\u2019s development. Incentives may include developers\u2019 fundings and rewards for node operators (e.g., miners). Membership : This dimension captures how new members participate in the network or development process. Communication : The community needs to communicate for a variety of purposes. Some communication channels include Telegram and GitHub, etc. Decision Making : This is arguably the most crucial dimension as it encompasses how decisions are made, monitored, and agreed upon. It\u2019s highly relevant to voting, consensus mechanisms, and conflict resolution, etc. Formation and Context : This overarching dimension includes the blockchain\u2019s background information such as purpose, licenses, and formative ideology, etc. Figure 6: Blockchain Governance analytical framework, Pelt et al. (2020) Why Blockchain Governance Matters To recapitulate, the point of having governance on the blockchain is to manage and coordinate an entire community toward the same goal (Nilsson and Garagol 2018) . Hence, the governance of a blockchain project is crucial for its sustainability since it enables stakeholders to discuss and make decisions on how the blockchain should evolve. From a risk point of view, the importance of governance is further highlighted by the governance issues that blockchains have suffered. A renowned example is the governance crisis that happened to Ethereum after the 2016 DAO Hack. This crisis began with a USD 50 million worth of ETH theft that took advantage of the critical vulnerabilities of a venture capital DApp (decentralized applications) named DAO. During the 28-day waiting period after the hack, core developers of Ethereum eventually decided to implement a controversial hard fork to return the stolen ETH. Of course, not everyone agreed with this decision and argued that it was a violation of the immutability principle of blockchain. The consequence of an unresolved hard fork is having two versions of Ethereum (the one without the hard fork is called Ethereum Classic ). And a hard fork also marks a split of community and often comes with much market volatility even by crypto\u2019s standard. Bitcoin is also infamous for its several hard forks which put the whole project\u2019s survival in jeopardy. Figure 7: DAO hack and the hard fork that created Ethereum Classic Note that we are discussing blockchain governance rather than governance on DApps, which is interconnected but also poses unique risks. In Duke Professor Campbell Harvey\u2019s new book DeFi and the Future of Finance , he talks about the risks associated with DeFi, including governance risk. If you are interested in decentralized finance, I\u2019d highly suggest a read. On-chain vs. Off-chain Governance On-chain and off-chain governance are the two domains of blockchain governance each with its strengths and weaknesses. As briefly discussed earlier, on-chain governance means that decision-making rules are encoded into the protocol. Hence, this is a type of governance specific to blockchains. Changes to a blockchain are proposed through code updates. Subsequently, nodes can vote to accept or decline the change. Not all nodes have equal voting power. Nodes with greater holdings of coins have more votes as compared to nodes that have a relatively lesser number of holdings. Therefore, votes can be manipulated while the dynamic is skewed away from miners and developers towards users and investors, who may be simply interested in maximizing future profits as opposed to developing the protocol. While on-chain governance is relatively faster because developers are incentivized to implement code changes, it could have low voter participation given the absence of incentives for voter participation. This could exacerbate the issue of plutocracy where richer voters dominate the decision-making process. For off-chain governance, it is characterized by a higher degree of human involvement. One can view off-chain governance as first reaching consensus on a social level outside of the blockchain, and then encoding the decision to the protocol. For example, Ethereum users propose protocol updates through EIPs (Ethereum Improvement Proposals) on GitHub. Compared to on-chain governance, off-chain governance is significantly more centralized as a select few (e.g., community leaders) control the most power and thus have more say in the final decisions. Additionally, off-chain governance is sometimes criticized for a lack of transparency in making decisions. Figure 8: Summary of pros and cons of on-chain and off-chain governance (created by Whimsical) There is a massive amount of discussion around on-chain and off-chain governance. An earlier SciEcon debate on Ethereum also presented some sound arguments, see more in this article . Voting Mechanisms The voting mechanism is at the core of any governance, whether it is political or corporate, number or blockchain. The voting process allows voters to vote for or against a proposal. As discussed earlier, a key difference between representative and direct democracy is whether an individual gets to vote directly or through representatives. While there are lots of voting rules, the simplest and most frequently used one is the majority rule that is used in corporate shareholder meetings and the legislative process. However, a critical flaw of the majority rule is that majorities have the power to disregard the legitimate interests of minorities, which often fail to advance the greater good of the group. For instance, if one token represents one vote, then a few large token holders could vote for their narrower interests instead of the interests of the group, which essentially results in a form of plutocracy. One specific voting mechanism that can help reduce the power of wealthy token holders is quadratic voting. Proposed by Posner and Weyl (2014) , quadratic voting is a way of tackling the centralization of voting power by having the cost equal to the square of the number of votes, and voters can buy as many pro or con votes as they want. By doing so, it avoids the dominance of large token holders by allowing the minority to be able to buy more tokens (votes). It also discourages wealthy voters to buy a large number of votes because the marginal voting power with one additional vote diminishes. Figure 9: Illustration of how quadratic voting works (EXIMCHAIN) An interesting application of quadratic voting is a platform called Mogul using it to determine which movies will get made . Governance Types of Major Blockchains & DApps Below is a table briefly summarizing the governance types of major blockchains and decentralized applications (DApps). It is by no means exhaustive and does not capture the sophistications of their governance mechanisms, but it could allow us to have a glimpse into the governance of popular blockchains and DApps. Figure 10: Summary of governance types for major blockchains and Dapps \u00a9SciEcon 2021 At this point, one can build connections between traditional governance and blockchain governance. Bitcoin and Ethereum can be characterized as off-chain governance where stakeholders including users, node operators, developers, and miners all exert checks and balances on each other. For both Bitcoin and Ethereum , to introduce new ideas or features, developers need to submit proposals named Bitcoin/Ethereum Improvement Proposals (BIPs/EIPs). Various stakeholders are involved in this process and they need to reach a consensus for the change to be implemented. This checks and balances system is analogous to the US government, as argued by Fred Ehrsam : developers are like the Senate submitting pull requests to the community; the miners are like the Judiciary which decides whether or not proposals are adopted in practice; the nodes of the network are like the Executive can also veto by choosing not to run the version that is aligned with what the miners are running; the users like citizens in a nation-state can revolt (Ehrsam 2017) . Specifically, Ethereum has provided a more comprehensive introduction to governance which can be found here . For blockchains that adopt on-chain governance, the governance mechanisms are relatively more diverse. For instance, Cardano\u2019s decentralized on-chain governance is analogous to direct democracy in that each token holder is entitled and incentivized to vote on proposals to advance the network. Its goal is to give everyone a voice. According to its founder Dominic Williams, the Internet Computer adopts advanced liquid democracy called \u201cNetwork Nervous System\u201d. It \u201cexerts the will of the community, mediated through algorithms\u201d, tweeted Williams. The more innovative on-chain governance made possible by blockchain and powered by smart contracts has been the testing ground for better governance, which hopefully will have a positive impact on traditional governance in the future. Conclusion Governance in any context is an important steering force to long-term development and sustainability. With sound governance, countries and the public sector could function efficiently to benefit their people to create better social welfare; corporates could maximize profits for stakeholders over the long run while their strategies are aligned with the social good. On the other hand, to ensure that the disruptive power of blockchain could maximally contribute to the greater good, sound blockchain governance is indispensable. Therefore, governance in these three contexts could together contribute to a sustainable future. As a crucial component of a project\u2019s sustainability, Blockchain governance should be the focus when people seek to evaluate a project. As Coinbase co-founder and Duke Alumnus Fred Ehrsam stressed in a Medium article on blockchain governance: The fundamentals of cryptoeconomics and overarching governance schemas of these networks are critical to survival, under-appreciated, and poorly understood. Theorists and practitioners in this field are still examining and exploring the potential of more governance mechanisms. Meanwhile, more complex problems such as game-theoretic risks (e.g., collusion) are emerging and require more in-depth research on the governance aspect of this space. In addition to blockchain governance being crucial to a project, voting, as a vital part of governance, and blockchain appear to be a mutually beneficial pair. First, sound voting systems can ensure the best decisions for advancing the blockchain project. As discussed earlier, besides traditional voting systems like one token one vote, more sophisticated voting rules such as quadratic voting and liquid democracy (i.e., vote delegation and revoking) can be implemented to tackle issues that might impede a project\u2019s development. Second, blockchain technology can empower voting and make it more secure. Blockchain\u2019s immutability prevents the voting records from being tampered with. And as a distributed ledger, it can effectively protect the results from being hacked. In addition, blockchain also comes with anonymity, which meets the exact need of practical voting and particularly elections. Therefore, elements of governance such as voting mechanisms can steer blockchain towards a sustainable future, while blockchain with its unique characteristics grants a future of fairer and more secure voting.

Liquid democracy, requiring the functionality to delegate and revoke a vote, is a relatively recent proposition that is made feasible by blockchain technology. Moreover, the voting power passes transitively from one individual to the next, leading to a directed network graph connecting every voter to experts and politicians. According to Harvard Technology Review, the transitivity characteristic of liquidity democracy \u201callows for a network of more meaningful connections, rewarding a community\u2019s most trusted leaders while simultaneously empowering citizens to participate in the democratic process\u201d (Lu-Romeo, 2021) .

Each system of governance played to the strengths of its nation . In Greece, the citizens were well-educated, and power was central to the capital, whereas the Roman empire was massive and very diverse in terms of language and culture. It would have been impossible to get the opinion of every citizen in a timely manner. Therefore, the governance developed by each empire also reflected the structure of their societies: direct democracy for Greek and representative democracy for Roman. The statements stand for blockchain governance as well. Below is a summary of the pros & cons of the two forms of democracy (Massessi, 2020) .

More practically, a government in which elected officials appoint experts and professionals to administer individual government functions and recommend legislation can be considered technocratic. Technocracy may sound distant to mainstream governance types, but it was favored in the technocracy movement active in the United States and Canada in the 1930s. The technocracy movement arose in the midst of the Great Depression, which ushered in radically different ideas of social engineering (Wikipedia, 2019) . The advocates aimed to promote a society led by technical experts to tackle the inherent complexity of the economy. Ultimately, the movement was overshadowed by other proposals dealing with the Great Depression. Figure 5: The official symbol of the Technocracy movement (Technocracy Inc.), Wikipedia As we will discuss later in the article, off-chain governance is more similar to real-world politics since it is usually the group of people most familiar with the project (e.g., core developers) that have the most say in decision-making. Since off-chain governance relies more on human discretion, it poses a higher technical barrier for participants. Therefore, it is close to technocracy where the group of developers and community members with in-depth knowledge of the project control the majority of the decision-making power.","title":"Technocracy"},{"location":"articles/Research/BlockchainGovernanceforaSustainableFuture/#oligarchy-and-plutocracy","text":"Oligarchy literally means \u201cfor a few to rule or command\u201d and is a power structure where a small group of people controls the decision-making power. Plutocracy means a society ruled by the wealthy. These two types of governance are discussed side by side because they both mean that the power is distributed to a minority of people. Therefore, plutocracy, ruled by the wealthy minority, can be viewed as part of oligarchy, ruled by the privileged minority. For instance, Iran is characterized as an Islamic clerical oligarchy since the clerics control much of the power structure (National Geographic, 2021) . Some historical examples of plutocracy include the Roman Empire, some city-states in Ancient Greece, the civilization of Carthage, and the Dutch Republic (Wikipedia, 2019) . Having a centralized group of decision-makers determined by their wealth can undermine the project. If plutocratic governance arises on a blockchain (typically on-chain governance), in the most generic sense, a large coin-holder could have large voting power. However, the problem naturally emerges when coin-holder and blockchain user interests are not naturally aligned.

The protocol includes specifications such as how participants should be rewarded and how transactions are executed. To further develop the project, people involved in the blockchain project need to determine how updates should be made, and the process of updating the protocol should be coordinated. This is where blockchain governance is needed. As a distributed ledger, blockchain governance is inevitably different from traditional forms of governance. For example, it doesn\u2019t need any physical headquarters or CEO that oversees the project, but rather a network of developers for developing the protocol. This also poses a unique challenge: developers are responsible for implementing the code that distributes power amongst the blockchain stakeholders (Pelt et al. 2020) . In addition, whereas governments act as third parties between two actors trying to interact in society, one of the most celebrated characteristics of blockchain is the elimination of any intermediaries. This is analogous to the idea of \u201cgoverning without governments\u201d, which has implications on both blockchain and governance. Now, having a general idea of what blockchain is, we can examine blockchain governance through a systematic lens. Pelt et al. (2021) provide a comprehensive framework that allows comparison and analysis between governance frameworks. The proposed framework is supported by extensive literature and expert interviews. For simplicity, we include a concise summary of the components. 3 layers: On-chain and off-chain governance are the two main governance types for blockchain. As the name suggests, on-chain governance means that the decision-making process is embedded in the source code of the protocol. Off-chain governance, on the other hand, is similar to traditional forms of governance since the decision-making is less programmatic and more manual. Here, Pelt et al. (2020) further distinguish between off-chain community and development. We will discuss these two types in more detail in the later section. 6 dimensions: Roles : In any form of governance, different roles are accountable for different actions. In blockchain governance, roles may include a foundation, miners, and developers, etc. Incentives : Being able to incentivize different roles to contribute to the blockchain is crucial for the project\u2019s development. Incentives may include developers\u2019 fundings and rewards for node operators (e.g., miners). Membership : This dimension captures how new members participate in the network or development process. Communication : The community needs to communicate for a variety of purposes. Some communication channels include Telegram and GitHub, etc. Decision Making : This is arguably the most crucial dimension as it encompasses how decisions are made, monitored, and agreed upon. It\u2019s highly relevant to voting, consensus mechanisms, and conflict resolution, etc. Formation and Context : This overarching dimension includes the blockchain\u2019s background information such as purpose, licenses, and formative ideology, etc. Figure 6: Blockchain Governance analytical framework, Pelt et al. (2020)","title":"What is Blockchain Governance?"},{"location":"articles/Research/BlockchainGovernanceforaSustainableFuture/#why-blockchain-governance-matters","text":"To recapitulate, the point of having governance on the blockchain is to manage and coordinate an entire community toward the same goal (Nilsson and Garagol 2018) . Hence, the governance of a blockchain project is crucial for its sustainability since it enables stakeholders to discuss and make decisions on how the blockchain should evolve. From a risk point of view, the importance of governance is further highlighted by the governance issues that blockchains have suffered. A renowned example is the governance crisis that happened to Ethereum after the 2016 DAO Hack. This crisis began with a USD 50 million worth of ETH theft that took advantage of the critical vulnerabilities of a venture capital DApp (decentralized applications) named DAO. During the 28-day waiting period after the hack, core developers of Ethereum eventually decided to implement a controversial hard fork to return the stolen ETH. Of course, not everyone agreed with this decision and argued that it was a violation of the immutability principle of blockchain. The consequence of an unresolved hard fork is having two versions of Ethereum (the one without the hard fork is called Ethereum Classic ). And a hard fork also marks a split of community and often comes with much market volatility even by crypto\u2019s standard. Bitcoin is also infamous for its several hard forks which put the whole project\u2019s survival in jeopardy. Figure 7: DAO hack and the hard fork that created Ethereum Classic Note that we are discussing blockchain governance rather than governance on DApps, which is interconnected but also poses unique risks. In Duke Professor Campbell Harvey\u2019s new book DeFi and the Future of Finance , he talks about the risks associated with DeFi, including governance risk. If you are interested in decentralized finance, I\u2019d highly suggest a read.","title":"Why Blockchain Governance Matters"},{"location":"articles/Research/BlockchainGovernanceforaSustainableFuture/#on-chain-vs-off-chain-governance","text":"On-chain and off-chain governance are the two domains of blockchain governance each with its strengths and weaknesses. As briefly discussed earlier, on-chain governance means that decision-making rules are encoded into the protocol. Hence, this is a type of governance specific to blockchains. Changes to a blockchain are proposed through code updates. Subsequently, nodes can vote to accept or decline the change. Not all nodes have equal voting power. Nodes with greater holdings of coins have more votes as compared to nodes that have a relatively lesser number of holdings. Therefore, votes can be manipulated while the dynamic is skewed away from miners and developers towards users and investors, who may be simply interested in maximizing future profits as opposed to developing the protocol. While on-chain governance is relatively faster because developers are incentivized to implement code changes, it could have low voter participation given the absence of incentives for voter participation. This could exacerbate the issue of plutocracy where richer voters dominate the decision-making process. For off-chain governance, it is characterized by a higher degree of human involvement. One can view off-chain governance as first reaching consensus on a social level outside of the blockchain, and then encoding the decision to the protocol. For example, Ethereum users propose protocol updates through EIPs (Ethereum Improvement Proposals) on GitHub. Compared to on-chain governance, off-chain governance is significantly more centralized as a select few (e.g., community leaders) control the most power and thus have more say in the final decisions. Additionally, off-chain governance is sometimes criticized for a lack of transparency in making decisions. Figure 8: Summary of pros and cons of on-chain and off-chain governance (created by Whimsical) There is a massive amount of discussion around on-chain and off-chain governance. An earlier SciEcon debate on Ethereum also presented some sound arguments, see more in this article .","title":"On-chain vs. Off-chain Governance"},{"location":"articles/Research/BlockchainGovernanceforaSustainableFuture/#voting-mechanisms","text":"The voting mechanism is at the core of any governance, whether it is political or corporate, number or blockchain. The voting process allows voters to vote for or against a proposal. As discussed earlier, a key difference between representative and direct democracy is whether an individual gets to vote directly or through representatives. While there are lots of voting rules, the simplest and most frequently used one is the majority rule that is used in corporate shareholder meetings and the legislative process. However, a critical flaw of the majority rule is that majorities have the power to disregard the legitimate interests of minorities, which often fail to advance the greater good of the group. For instance, if one token represents one vote, then a few large token holders could vote for their narrower interests instead of the interests of the group, which essentially results in a form of plutocracy. One specific voting mechanism that can help reduce the power of wealthy token holders is quadratic voting. Proposed by Posner and Weyl (2014) , quadratic voting is a way of tackling the centralization of voting power by having the cost equal to the square of the number of votes, and voters can buy as many pro or con votes as they want. By doing so, it avoids the dominance of large token holders by allowing the minority to be able to buy more tokens (votes). It also discourages wealthy voters to buy a large number of votes because the marginal voting power with one additional vote diminishes. Figure 9: Illustration of how quadratic voting works (EXIMCHAIN) An interesting application of quadratic voting is a platform called Mogul using it to determine which movies will get made .","title":"Voting Mechanisms"},{"location":"articles/Research/BlockchainGovernanceforaSustainableFuture/#governance-types-of-major-blockchains-dapps","text":"Below is a table briefly summarizing the governance types of major blockchains and decentralized applications (DApps). It is by no means exhaustive and does not capture the sophistications of their governance mechanisms, but it could allow us to have a glimpse into the governance of popular blockchains and DApps. Figure 10: Summary of governance types for major blockchains and Dapps \u00a9SciEcon 2021 At this point, one can build connections between traditional governance and blockchain governance. Bitcoin and Ethereum can be characterized as off-chain governance where stakeholders including users, node operators, developers, and miners all exert checks and balances on each other. For both Bitcoin and Ethereum , to introduce new ideas or features, developers need to submit proposals named Bitcoin/Ethereum Improvement Proposals (BIPs/EIPs). Various stakeholders are involved in this process and they need to reach a consensus for the change to be implemented. This checks and balances system is analogous to the US government, as argued by Fred Ehrsam : developers are like the Senate submitting pull requests to the community; the miners are like the Judiciary which decides whether or not proposals are adopted in practice; the nodes of the network are like the Executive can also veto by choosing not to run the version that is aligned with what the miners are running; the users like citizens in a nation-state can revolt (Ehrsam 2017) . Specifically, Ethereum has provided a more comprehensive introduction to governance which can be found here . For blockchains that adopt on-chain governance, the governance mechanisms are relatively more diverse. For instance, Cardano\u2019s decentralized on-chain governance is analogous to direct democracy in that each token holder is entitled and incentivized to vote on proposals to advance the network. Its goal is to give everyone a voice. According to its founder Dominic Williams, the Internet Computer adopts advanced liquid democracy called \u201cNetwork Nervous System\u201d. It \u201cexerts the will of the community, mediated through algorithms\u201d, tweeted Williams. The more innovative on-chain governance made possible by blockchain and powered by smart contracts has been the testing ground for better governance, which hopefully will have a positive impact on traditional governance in the future.","title":"Governance Types of Major Blockchains &amp; DApps"},{"location":"articles/Research/BlockchainGovernanceforaSustainableFuture/#conclusion","text":"Governance in any context is an important steering force to long-term development and sustainability. With sound governance, countries and the public sector could function efficiently to benefit their people to create better social welfare; corporates could maximize profits for stakeholders over the long run while their strategies are aligned with the social good. On the other hand, to ensure that the disruptive power of blockchain could maximally contribute to the greater good, sound blockchain governance is indispensable. Therefore, governance in these three contexts could together contribute to a sustainable future. As a crucial component of a project\u2019s sustainability, Blockchain governance should be the focus when people seek to evaluate a project. As Coinbase co-founder and Duke Alumnus Fred Ehrsam stressed in a Medium article on blockchain governance: The fundamentals of cryptoeconomics and overarching governance schemas of these networks are critical to survival, under-appreciated, and poorly understood. Theorists and practitioners in this field are still examining and exploring the potential of more governance mechanisms. Meanwhile, more complex problems such as game-theoretic risks (e.g., collusion) are emerging and require more in-depth research on the governance aspect of this space. In addition to blockchain governance being crucial to a project, voting, as a vital part of governance, and blockchain appear to be a mutually beneficial pair. First, sound voting systems can ensure the best decisions for advancing the blockchain project. As discussed earlier, besides traditional voting systems like one token one vote, more sophisticated voting rules such as quadratic voting and liquid democracy (i.e., vote delegation and revoking) can be implemented to tackle issues that might impede a project\u2019s development. Second, blockchain technology can empower voting and make it more secure. Blockchain\u2019s immutability prevents the voting records from being tampered with. And as a distributed ledger, it can effectively protect the results from being hacked. In addition, blockchain also comes with anonymity, which meets the exact need of practical voting and particularly elections. Therefore, elements of governance such as voting mechanisms can steer blockchain towards a sustainable future, while blockchain with its unique characteristics grants a future of fairer and more secure voting.","title":"Conclusion"},{"location":"articles/Research/BlockchainGovernanceforaSustainableFuture/#author-lewis-tian","text":"Supervisor: Prof. Luyao Zhang","title":"Author: Lewis Tian"},{"location":"articles/Research/BlockchainGovernanceforaSustainableFuture/#acknowledgments","text":"Design: Austen Li Executive Editor: Xinyu Tian Chief Editor: Prof. Luyao Zhang","title":"Acknowledgments:"},{"location":"articles/Research/CryptocurrencyExchanges%3AAGuidetoSmartTransactions/","text":"Cryptocurrency Exchanges: A Guide to Smart Transactions I ntroduction: An exchange is a place where buyers and sellers can match and set their orders, while these can be physical marketplaces, nowadays, most people exchange on digital platforms that facilitate this process ( Kenton 2020 ; Kennon 2021 ).

Disclaimer: This article is a final deliverable from the course activities in Econ 101: Economics Principal instructed by Prof. Luyao Zhang at Duke Kunshan University [1], Autumn 2021. Prof. Campbell Harvey at Fuqua School of Business, Duke University [2] gave a guest lecture entitled \u201cDeFi and the Future of Finance\u201d as a distinguished invited speaker for this course. Xinyu Tian, majoring in Data Science, and Tianyu Wu, majoring in Applied Mathematics and Computational Sciences/Math from the class of 2023 are the Teaching Assistants for this course. Instructor highlights: Fei Wu insightfully identifies the progress and regress of DeFi from CeFi from three facets of immutability, transparency, accessibility. Moreover, Fei also points out how we can make DeFi more inclusive. Opening Remarks Decentralized applications(DApps) are computer applications that run on a decentralized computing system and perform financial functions on blockchains. There are two types of blockchains: permissionless blockchain and permissioned blockchain. The permissioned blockchain in a closed network that allows access only to the selected and verified participants makes chaining transactions an unhelpful structure compared with traditional finance( Seth 2019 ; Solat, Calvez, and Na\u00eft-Abdesselam 2021 ). Different from traditional applications and the Dapps on permissioned blockchains, the Dapps on permissionless blockchains allow every entity to join and leave freely, and the data and computation in them are provided by a peer-to-peer network( Peng et al. 2020 ). That indicates it must be open-source and function independently of any participants. The data and records must be accessible to the public for verification, and the network must be secured using a cryptographic token. Therefore, the DApps on permissionless blockchains are featured by immutability, transparency, accessibility . This article is a debate dialogue to examine whether the DeFi applications on permissionless blockchain functions well in terms of the three features. First, from the perspective of immutability, the debaters will explore the impact of immutability on system security and how smart contract risks can be overcome on permissionless blockchains. Then, the debate team will analyze the pros and cons of transparency and suggest potential approaches to overcome hacking attacks. Finally, on the level of accessibility, our debaters explored and questioned whether the DApps on permissionless blockchains could improve the coverage of financial services. The whole debate process is shown in Figure 1 . All DApps mentioned in this article later are based on permissionless blockchains by default. Figure 1: The Process of Debate with A Dialectic Method (created by Whimsical) Thesis Pro 1(Immutability): Once information is stored on the public blockchains, no one can change it without the consent of the participants. Because a decentralized application stores all of its data on the blockchain, it is both immutable and safe after being certified by the open network. Even the DApp\u2019s creator is unable to tamper with the data once it has been added to the blockchain. This comprises both financial and non-financial transactions carried out by smart contracts, as well as user data and other information. Con 1 (Immutability): Smart contracts bring a new risk that does not exist in most text-based contractual relationships: an accidental programming error in the code or protocol ( Levi and Lipton 2018 ). The errors are unavoidable and inevitable, and immutable smart contracts can magnify the errors. Fixing any errors in DApps is challenging since it requires each peer in the network to update all of the copies in the network, which can be quite a challenging task. Pro 2 (Transparency): All DApp codes should be open source, which means anyone can view them and verify the developers\u2019 assertions about what they can accomplish. DApps, which are based on decentralized systems or blockchains, aim to create a completely open, transparent, and accountable environment for public involvement ( Farnaghi and Mansourian 2020 ). Compared with traditional financial agreements, smart contracts can provide a higher level of security and transparency as these transparent incentive structures ( Harvey, Ramachandran, and Santoro 2021 ). Con 2 (Transparency): Since DApps are open source, these public audited smart contracts also become a hacker attack medium. As DApps highly depend on open-source smart contracts, hackers have a unique chance to probe networks for flaws, posing a severe threat to participants\u2019 security ( Hussey and Chipolina 2020 ; Wang et al. 2021 ). Therefore, in this sense, the transparency of DApps is a disadvantage and hinders its progress. Pro 3 (Accessibility): DApps will not shut down for any reason. As long as the Ethereum network remains active, DApps built on top of it will maintain activity and availability. If one of the nodes executing the smart contract fails, the application\u2019s overall stability will not be affected because the resulting data remains the same. Data is distributed over a number of nodes or individual client computers that provide computational power to the network, due to the way a decentralized network operates ( Heydecker 2021 ). Because network configurations and all data are secured on the blockchain across all devices rather than one specific location, even if one node is attacked and compromised, the network remains entirely secure ( Heydecker 2021 ). This also means that a firm can\u2019t sell or misuse your information because smart contracts, not human administrators, are in charge of it. Con 3 (Accessibility): The participants might lose access to the information if they lose the key or lock the private key in self-custody. This problem is irreversible, and there is no other way to unlock or reset the key. Aside from the risk of losing or locking the private key in self-custody, there is also the risk of the escrow organization being hacked in delegated custody ( Harvey, Ramachandran, and Santoro 2021 ). Antithesis Pro 1 (Immutability): The immutability of DApps increases security and user trust in DApps. All the data in DApps is authenticated by the network and cannot be changed by anyone, even the creator. Without the central bank\u2019s involvement, users will not be disadvantaged, which also improves users\u2019 trust in DApps. Con 1 (Immutability): DApps are based on Ethereum and other blockchains with fixed block sizes and lack scalability. The immutable block size places DApps at risk of not meeting requisite demand in the future ( Harvey, Ramachandran, and Santoro 2021 ). At this point, it\u2019s unrealistic to expect DApp to process all of the financial transactions for a global financial market. Pro 2 (Transparency): Smart contract-driven DApps are publicly auditable. These protocols typically have decentralized governance organizations to ensure that everyone knows what\u2019s going on and that no malicious actor can individually make malicious decisions. Compared with centralized finance, customers are in a more equal position in DApps, and their rights and interests are protected to a greater extent. Con 2 (Transparency): In order to realize information transparency, anonymity is an essential part of DApps. However, anonymity limits the possibility of off-chain enforcement or legal intervention. In DApps, reputation is not a suitable substitute for the balance of interests. All debt should be backed by staked collateral, which is transparent and enforceable ( Harvey, Ramachandran, and Santoro 2021 ). Pro 3 (Accessibility): DApps are expected to eliminate the problem of limited access in CeFi limitations. Now, there are around 1.7 billion people who are not banked. Those people cannot get access to the services provided by banks. Among the 1.7 billion people who are not banked, two-thirds of them have mobile phones, which means they may be able to join the DApps ( Harvey, Ramachandran, and Santoro 2021 ). Thus, after the large-scale application of DApps, more and more people can participate in the decentralized financial trade. Con 3 (Accessibility): In today\u2019s world, the lack of mobile phone and internet coverage still limits the promotion of DApps. Now, approximately one billion people worldwide still do not have mobile phones, and a third of the world\u2019s population is unable to connect to the internet ( Turner 2021 ). Therefore, the application of DApps may prevent more people from participating in financial activities at the same time. There is still a long way to go before decentralized applications are available to everyone. Synthesis: Pro 1(Immutability): With all the data stored on the blockchain and certified by the network, no one can tamper with the data and maliciously harm the interests of others. Thus, immutability, as one of the outstanding features of DApps, can improve the security of DApps and enhance users\u2019 trust in DApps. Furthermore, more and more potential customers will be attracted and join the DeFi system. Con 1(Immutability): Since smart contract risks plague DApps, overcoming them is crucial to DApps achieving mainstream adoption. Also, the poor scalability limits the future application and spread of DApps. Through careful mechanism design, DApps can overcome the drawbacks of smart contract risks and limited scalability and then create a both secure and flexible system. Pro 2(Transparency): Public exposure and transaction transparency cannot be achieved by traditional finance. The public nature of DeFi fosters trust and security where there may traditionally exist opacity ( Harvey, Ramachandran, and Santoro 2021 ). Through the public audit, the rights of customers are respected and protected to a greater extent, which is helpful to attract more potential customers Con 2(Transparency): The transparency of DApps will make customers expect more from them. Smart-contract programming still has a long way to go before best practices are developed, and complex smart contracts have the resilience necessary to handle high-value transactions( Harvey, Ramachandran, and Santoro 2021 ). More research is needed in order to prevent the suspicion that DApps cannot be protected against attacks by hackers. At the same time, relevant laws and regulations should be established to deal with the problem of hacking. Pro 3 (Accessibility): In general, DApps can build a more stable system and allow more people to participate in financial activities due to its decentralized data distribution approach. Decentralization and improved access, which allows financial products to be collectively owned by communities, are crucial to preventing widening wealth gaps ( Harvey, Ramachandran, and Santoro 2021 ). Con 3 (Accessibility): It has been examined that lack of coverage of the internet and mobile phone is an obstacle to the promotion of DApps. In order to ensure that more people can participate in DApps, it is essential to popularize the internet and establish a more secure and stable network environment.

There are two types of blockchains: permissionless blockchain and permissioned blockchain. The permissioned blockchain in a closed network that allows access only to the selected and verified participants makes chaining transactions an unhelpful structure compared with traditional finance( Seth 2019 ; Solat, Calvez, and Na\u00eft-Abdesselam 2021 ). Different from traditional applications and the Dapps on permissioned blockchains, the Dapps on permissionless blockchains allow every entity to join and leave freely, and the data and computation in them are provided by a peer-to-peer network( Peng et al. 2020 ). That indicates it must be open-source and function independently of any participants. The data and records must be accessible to the public for verification, and the network must be secured using a cryptographic token. Therefore, the DApps on permissionless blockchains are featured by immutability, transparency, accessibility . This article is a debate dialogue to examine whether the DeFi applications on permissionless blockchain functions well in terms of the three features. First, from the perspective of immutability, the debaters will explore the impact of immutability on system security and how smart contract risks can be overcome on permissionless blockchains. Then, the debate team will analyze the pros and cons of transparency and suggest potential approaches to overcome hacking attacks. Finally, on the level of accessibility, our debaters explored and questioned whether the DApps on permissionless blockchains could improve the coverage of financial services. The whole debate process is shown in Figure 1 . All DApps mentioned in this article later are based on permissionless blockchains by default. Figure 1: The Process of Debate with A Dialectic Method (created by Whimsical)","title":"Opening Remarks"},{"location":"articles/Research/DoesDeFiApplicationFunctionWellinTermsoftheFeaturesofImmutabilityTransparencyandAccessibility/#thesis","text":"Pro 1(Immutability): Once information is stored on the public blockchains, no one can change it without the consent of the participants. Because a decentralized application stores all of its data on the blockchain, it is both immutable and safe after being certified by the open network. Even the DApp\u2019s creator is unable to tamper with the data once it has been added to the blockchain. This comprises both financial and non-financial transactions carried out by smart contracts, as well as user data and other information. Con 1 (Immutability): Smart contracts bring a new risk that does not exist in most text-based contractual relationships: an accidental programming error in the code or protocol ( Levi and Lipton 2018 ). The errors are unavoidable and inevitable, and immutable smart contracts can magnify the errors. Fixing any errors in DApps is challenging since it requires each peer in the network to update all of the copies in the network, which can be quite a challenging task. Pro 2 (Transparency): All DApp codes should be open source, which means anyone can view them and verify the developers\u2019 assertions about what they can accomplish. DApps, which are based on decentralized systems or blockchains, aim to create a completely open, transparent, and accountable environment for public involvement ( Farnaghi and Mansourian 2020 ). Compared with traditional financial agreements, smart contracts can provide a higher level of security and transparency as these transparent incentive structures ( Harvey, Ramachandran, and Santoro 2021 ). Con 2 (Transparency): Since DApps are open source, these public audited smart contracts also become a hacker attack medium. As DApps highly depend on open-source smart contracts, hackers have a unique chance to probe networks for flaws, posing a severe threat to participants\u2019 security ( Hussey and Chipolina 2020 ; Wang et al. 2021 ). Therefore, in this sense, the transparency of DApps is a disadvantage and hinders its progress. Pro 3 (Accessibility): DApps will not shut down for any reason. As long as the Ethereum network remains active, DApps built on top of it will maintain activity and availability. If one of the nodes executing the smart contract fails, the application\u2019s overall stability will not be affected because the resulting data remains the same. Data is distributed over a number of nodes or individual client computers that provide computational power to the network, due to the way a decentralized network operates ( Heydecker 2021 ). Because network configurations and all data are secured on the blockchain across all devices rather than one specific location, even if one node is attacked and compromised, the network remains entirely secure ( Heydecker 2021 ). This also means that a firm can\u2019t sell or misuse your information because smart contracts, not human administrators, are in charge of it. Con 3 (Accessibility): The participants might lose access to the information if they lose the key or lock the private key in self-custody. This problem is irreversible, and there is no other way to unlock or reset the key. Aside from the risk of losing or locking the private key in self-custody, there is also the risk of the escrow organization being hacked in delegated custody ( Harvey, Ramachandran, and Santoro 2021 ).","title":"Thesis"},{"location":"articles/Research/DoesDeFiApplicationFunctionWellinTermsoftheFeaturesofImmutabilityTransparencyandAccessibility/#antithesis","text":"Pro 1 (Immutability): The immutability of DApps increases security and user trust in DApps. All the data in DApps is authenticated by the network and cannot be changed by anyone, even the creator. Without the central bank\u2019s involvement, users will not be disadvantaged, which also improves users\u2019 trust in DApps. Con 1 (Immutability): DApps are based on Ethereum and other blockchains with fixed block sizes and lack scalability. The immutable block size places DApps at risk of not meeting requisite demand in the future ( Harvey, Ramachandran, and Santoro 2021 ). At this point, it\u2019s unrealistic to expect DApp to process all of the financial transactions for a global financial market. Pro 2 (Transparency): Smart contract-driven DApps are publicly auditable. These protocols typically have decentralized governance organizations to ensure that everyone knows what\u2019s going on and that no malicious actor can individually make malicious decisions. Compared with centralized finance, customers are in a more equal position in DApps, and their rights and interests are protected to a greater extent. Con 2 (Transparency): In order to realize information transparency, anonymity is an essential part of DApps. However, anonymity limits the possibility of off-chain enforcement or legal intervention. In DApps, reputation is not a suitable substitute for the balance of interests. All debt should be backed by staked collateral, which is transparent and enforceable ( Harvey, Ramachandran, and Santoro 2021 ).

They can be minted, bought, and sold on a certain marketplace. You might wonder what would be the difference between the NFT and cryptocurrency: that is, one of its remarkable properties is that it is actually a unique unit of data stored on a digital ledger that is not interchangeable ( Trautman, 2021 ). However, it is still a mystery whether we should treat NFT as a commodity or a new item to be defined in this new decentralized world, and how we can apply those existing US Laws to identify its corresponding properties in order to regulate NFT market behavior, thus maintaining the blockchain ecology. Figure 1: What are NFTs? How to distinguish between ownership and underlying intellectual property rights in NFT? Unique Ownership Owning an NFT is similar to owning a photograph of a basketball player stuck in the room, thus it is natural to consider that only one person can own an NFT. However, in the real life, it is difficult to determine whether the owner of that photograph would own underlying intellectual property rights, for example, making copies, printing, or creating other derivative works if he/she actually obtained that NFT from a transaction ( Bain et al., 2021 ). From this point of view, we propose that they have the right to own, sell, lend, or otherwise transfer the NFT itself, nonetheless, they don\u2019t have the right to make or sell copies of the digital art, to transfer the copyright in the work, or to create derivative works based on the original, unless a \u201cwritten\u201d copyright transfer is done (We will further talk about the copyright transfer in Part 2). Ownership and Underlying Intellectual Property Rights The ownership [2] of NFT as a unique digital asset against ownership of the actual content that the NFT is connected to requires clear discrimination. In other words, an NFT is minted and created to represent the work of art or other productions behind, but it does not mean that any subsequent buyer and owner of the NFT would automatically own other underlying intellectual property [3] rights, among which the copyright is especially dominant. When someone purchases an NFT linked to several contents, they do not directly mean to purchase the underlying intellectual property rights ( Mahmood, 2021 ). NFT is nothing but a non-fungible unique cryptographic token. Under Section 14 of the Copyright Act , \u201ca copyright owner has certain exclusive rights to reproduce, prepare adaptations of a work, perform, display, and distribute the copyrighted works in public\u201d. According to this article, we would claim that for any original works, the author should own the copyright, except that the author is hired to make these contents, and there are other contracts signed by the two sides to note the belonging of the copyright explicitly. And in the general case, there is a common sense that the purchase behavior itself does not mean to transfer all copyright to the buyers ( Stim, 2019 ). If the NFT owner is explicitly permitted by the seller that some of the intellectual property rights are transferred, the NFT owner is not allowed to make use of the elements in the creative work adhered to the NFT and create copies in order to distribute in any form to the public. If you are still confused about how these different concepts relate or differ, here is a vivid example for you to understand: The NFT of the American celebrity basketball player LeBron James\u2019 dunk video was released as the limited-edition digital collectors that are sold on the \u201cTop Shot\u201d market. It turns out that the card describing a dunk can sell with lots of money, but NBA still reserves the copyright to the original video, as well as any future reproduction of the video rights. Therefore, for the owner of the NBA NFT, it is possible to display the image in a certain way but still must not change the video moments captured in your NFT or sell anything related to your NFT without the prior consent of the NBA. Commodities are used for any commercial purpose. In addition, all license terms set by the owner of the underlying intellectual property rights shall be complied with ( Young, 2021 ). Figure 2: Intellectual Property In order to avoid being stuck in potential trouble caused by misunderstanding or neglect, developers ought to overcome these shortcomings since these can be mitigated with either the technology itself or through suitable wordings in the Assignment/license/intellectual property transfer smart contracts associated with the NFT. That is to say, if there is a mechanism within the NFT platform to create custom made smart contracts that could draw the line as to the originality of the assets, the rights conferred, royalties, if any, etc., then the problems associated with the market regarding intellectual property infringement associated with the sale of NFTs could be brought down. In addition, the introduction of necessary demarcation of rights and liabilities for a creative art buyer with implications of the potential creation of NFT would help the buyer sell the work in an NFT marketplace in the future. Now that we have a clear understanding of how the differences between ownership and intellectual property look, we are also curious about if someone misunderstood their relationship, how will copyfraud and infringement have an impact on the blockchain ecology? How to avoid copyfraud and improve the transparency and legitimacy of NFT assets transfer? Copyfraud and infringement of copyright: From the last section, we notice that it is quite difficult to differentiate between ownership and other intellectual properties in the NFT, especially for ordinary people. Therefore, the minting and sale in the marketplace are vulnerable to \u2018copyfraud\u2019 [4] and the infringement [5] of the copyright of the basic work and moral rights. Copyfraud often occurs when a person mints an NFT of a public domain work, falsely claims to own the copyright. Similarly, if a person is not the author or copyright owner of the underlying assets for which copyright exists, casting NFTs and misrepresenting them as the author or copyright owner of the work may infringe copyright and moral rights ( Lewis et al., 2021 ). We have seen an instance of works in the public domain from the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam that were turned into an NFT. Another one is about a 12-year-old programmer named Benyamin Ahmed who launched his own NFT project. His 3,350 computer-generated \u201cWeird Whales\u201d almost instantly sold out for 3 ETH each ($6,000). However, while this hype took place, one user found that the artwork \u201cpixel whale\u201d seemed to be copied directly from another pr o ject , using pixel images from four years ago ( Schmalfeld, 2021 ). However, we are still not clear whether the artwork \u201cWeird Whales\u201d project improperly makes use of others\u2019 intellectual property rights, since that base image may have been placed in the public domain and the original artist may have announced explicit permission for anyone to use. \u201cCopyfraud, as the term is used in this Article, refers to claiming falsely a copyright in a public domain work. These false copyright claims, which are often accompanied by threatened litigation for reproducing a work without the putative \u201cowner\u2019s\u201d permission, result in users seeking licenses and paying fees to reproduce works that are free for everyone to use, or altering their creative projects to excise the uncopyrighted material.\u201d( Jason Mazzone, 2006 ) Figure 3: Copyfraud Meanwhile, we are also seeing some artists start complaining about social media that their works were being minted into NFTs without their permission. It turns out that the physical asset is not on the blockchain, but the token itself has been in. This means that access to this item depends on whether the site hosting is online or not. When the seller of the NFT is not the true holder of the copyright, the problems of copyfraud and copyright infringement raise. At the same time, similar issues happen in stock image libraries, where their terms may require anyone uploading images to have the necessary copyrights, but anyone who has access to high-resolution images that are attractive to others can still try your luck and submit this image to profit from any sales ( Golowczynski, 2021 ). Why does the infringement issue show up? Let\u2019s delve into the loophole behind NFT: One advantage to purchasing an NFT is that all authentication is done on the blockchain. As long as the buyer is eligible to confirm that the original selling account can be successfully linked to the artist, then no matter how many rounds this item has been in the transaction, the buyer can still verify whether the purchased piece is authentic ( Schmalfeld, 2021 ). However, what the blockchain does not explicitly inform the buyer is whether the piece of work is simply a copy of one\u2019s intellectual property or not. Thus, we would assert that constructing a centralized administrative mechanism for identifying the public domain/true owners, like storing copyright into government-leading databases, might be a resolution to contain the copyfraud/infringement of copyright. The legitimacy of NFT assets transfer Some platforms offer to build in copyright elements into the sale, such as copyright transfer; Mintable for example includes a tick-box that allows the person minting a work to \u201cTransfer Copyright\u201d. ( Guadamuz, 2021 ) Figure 4: Copyright Transfer interface in Mintable(an NFT market shop) With regards to the transfer of copyright, Copyright Law of the United States establishes copyright assignment as requiring that \u201cany or all of the copyright owner\u2019s exclusive rights, or parts of those rights, can be transferred. The transfer, however, generally must be made in writing and signed by the owner of the rights conveyed or the owner\u2019s authorized agent.\u201d In the widest sense, an assignment of copyright means that the ownership of work will be transferred to the assignee, and they can therefore do with the work as they want. So you might ask whether the design of the Copyright Transfer Interface is applicable and legitimate? With regards to the use of a tick box to generate a copyright assignment, this could be akin to what is known as a click-wrap agreement, namely legal documents that are usually entered into by the click of a button. This is a widely accepted practice, and there is substantial case law accepting the use of \u201cI Agree\u201d click buttons. It would appear that as long as it is clear that the party is willing to make a copyright assignment according to what they \u201csay and do\u201d, then the ticking of a box, the filling of a form, and the signing of a token electronically could all be taken together to evidence the existence of an assignment. Thus, it allows a more personalized realization of transferring all or part of the copyright in the smart contract. First of all, we should be aware that, when it comes to copyright, we\u2019re actually talking about multiple rights. It includes the right of reproducing, selling, licensing, or otherwise transferring the copyright of the original work, as well as making derivative works. Here is an example for Music Contracts : \u201cWith respect to music minted into an NFT, you could draft the associated smart contract with provisions that provide performance rights only to the purchaser of the NFT while retaining all other rights for the artist, who could then sell one of those other rights (such as the synch rights) to a different purchaser of a separate NFT. The open nature of the blockchain means it is relatively easy to track these various rights as they pass from party to party and makes tracking any associated royalty streams relatively easy compared to current standards\u201d ( Barsky, 2021 ). But what does \u201cin writing\u201d and \u201csigned\u201d mean exactly to ensure its legitimacy? It is accepted widely that electronic documents can be used to conduct contracts. Although the ESIGN Act is a federal law, if all parties to the contract use electronic documents and sign electronically, electronic signatures and records will be legally recognized. It is also equivalent to what the General Rule of Validity has stressed, that \u201cNo contract, signature, or record shall be denied legal effect solely because it is in electronic form\u201d. This means that in practical terms there is a wide range of types of signatures being accepted as valid by the courts. While existing rules are broad and inclusive to various electronic formats, it\u2019s not yet clear if this could include the type of cryptographic signature that is used to sign an NFT. Also, the formal validity of smart contracts as contracts is still in heated debate. However, there has been a recent consultation by the UK Jurisdiction Taskforce looking specifically at cryptographic assets such as tokens, and they believe that there is no reason to believe that private-key signatures would not be classed as electronic signatures for any legal purpose. The recognition of NFT assets transfer acting as valid forms of transferring rights represents the general trends. Still, there is nothing stopping an author from using both an NFT to transfer ownership of a digital asset electronically, while writing a document in natural language and with a physical signature to ensure the buyer that there has been a proper transfer of rights. This is the preferred solution of some platforms that are offering copyright transfer as part of their services. The platform Hup Life is planning to include what they call a \u201csecond layer NFT\u201d which will comply with copyright formalities in order to \u201ctransfer a full bundle of rights. Transparency, Privacy, and Anonymity: NFT\u2019s advantages and implications Transparency What differentiates the NFT marketplace from the real-world art market? Or what is the merit of NFT that the latter one does not possess, which puts all of us into a frenzy nowadays? The transparency of NFTs is the answer we are increasingly hearing to those questions recently. On one hand, the \u201cphysical\u201d art world is largely based on the opacity of art transaction information. The past auction house sales are the only reliable public evidence that sets the estimate of value for artworks. Conversely, NFTs are transparent in the sense that no one is capable of manipulating the record of ownership or copying a new NFT. To a certain extent, the transparency associated with the Ethereum blockchain and digital art allows us to track every transaction, which is a key element in the field of innovative art. For example, if you trace down the transaction of the one digital art collector NFT called @4156 buying the work \u201cDeath Dip\u201d by the artist XCOPY on the SuperRare platform for the sum of 1,735,000 dollars, then at that moment the balance of the digital wallets is approximately 769.55 ETH ($1,667,741) in that of the artist and 301.31 ETH ($653,757) ( Concas, 2021 ). With their wallet address, it is easy to further track the subsequent input and output transactions. Figure 5: An NFT marketplace touting its transparency Privacy and Anonymity Even though it seems that blockchain, smart contracts, and NFT have solved some problems in the current popular centralized data collection application model, they are not able to adequately solve these problems if the context and situation of the application are considered. ( Cornelius, 2021 ). Traditional Internet Companies depend on centralized intermediaries to verify personal data. For example, Google utilizes an authentication service to verify user data and offers protection policies to ensure user privacy. In comparison, NFTs transactions manifest great advantages. NFTs transactions can be made directly between buyer and seller using smart contracts where personal information is directly shared with third parties. Using blockchain technology, creating identity mechanisms becomes possible for verifying and collecting necessary data in a decentralized manner, without ever sharing it directly with counterparties. Thus, NFTs guarantee user anonymity by storing personal data into non-fungible tokens that interact directly with smart contracts. However, the anonymity features of NFTs also bring about regulation problems, such as nefarious money laundering issues. Because digital art is both newer and more subjective in pricing because collectors and financiers are struggling with a series of new issues that revolve around the value of the artwork if it can never be actually viewed or stored. This creates a perfect environment for crime because dealers and sellers can determine the value of a work and compare prices with little historical background. Therefore, it is an excellent cover for money laundering, adding more confidentiality to an already challenging market, where location, identity, and source of funds are usually kept secret. Criminals could \u201cclean\u201d dirty money by generating an anonymous NFT, selling it on the blockchain, and purchasing it from himself or herself from an anonymous digital wallet with illicit funds. The money would be regarded as legitimate funds from the sale of the artwork. It seems that using illegal cash to buy NFTs from yourself is a simple way to transfer funds while claiming that these funds are used for legitimate art purchases and tax avoidance in the process ( Young, 2021 ). Due to anonymity, high-value transactions, and limited global regulatory issues, art transactions have historically been vulnerable to crime. What to expect from the regulation side is that AMLA enacted provisions, \u201cstudy the potential expansion of requirements to persons engaged in the art trade,\u201d which may include NFTs. In addition, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) [6], a money laundering and terrorist financing regulatory agency, has issued new guidelines for its so-called \u201cvirtual assets\u201d and related risks. ( Woloszynski, 2021 ) How can royalties be defined and integrated into the asset transfer to incentivize artists\u2019 creation and increase liquidity? What are NFT royalties? Every time your original NFT is sold on the market, NFT royalties [7] will provide you with a percentage of the sale price. NFT royalties are permanent and will be automatically implemented by smart contracts. For the majority of the markets, a royalty percentage can be personalized, and 5\u201310% is commonly regarded as standard royalties ( Gomezz, 2021 ). Figure 6: Royalties But you may wonder whether there is a difference between other traditional royalty payments and that in the NFT market. NFT royalties are automatically paid to the author in the second sale. They are encoded into smart contracts on the blockchain. Every time a second sale occurs, the smart contract will ensure that the terms of the NFT are fulfilled. If royalties are specified, part of the profits will go to the artist who created them ( Gomezz, 2021 ). The prerequisite for generating NFT is that it must be specifically identified in the articles. Whenever the smart contract terms are written clearly, the remaining will be processed automatically. Although traditionally after the first sale, artists or creators cannot track subsequent transactions of their works ( Chernichaw et al., 2021 ). Once they sell their work, all their income will come from that work. No matter how the reputation has increased in the future, they cannot get any other benefits sold before. On the other hand, if they wait for the right time, buyers of their works can regret and further sell the same work at a higher price. This resulted in artists being unable to get a cent from subsequent sales, no matter how high their prices were. Therefore, the common concept of artists is that of poor or hungry artists. NFT brings the opportunity to completely change this situation. Artists can get a permanent fair share of their work. Why are NFT royalties important? NFT royalties are a quite easy way and a good opportunity for artists, composers, and other original content creators to profit from their original work, and this might be quite difficult to happen in the traditional item in real-life ( Chernichaw et al., 2021 ). NFT is actually a way to democratize payment. Now, based on popularity, celebrities can get paid as easily as sports superstars. They also benefit from the secondary sale of their works, which is fair. Another cool thing about NFT is that the tokens can be sold, but the basic copyright still belongs to the creator. Authors now can even separate the intellectual properties into different segments and thus sell a certain percentage to potential buyers. Since NFT Royalties develop a new function that whenever one NFT is resold, according to the presets of smart contract, part of the royalties will follow the flow to send back to the creation (intellectual property owners). However, there is still a grey area that there is no mechanism/law to regulate how royalties will be distributed among creators, owners, and other intermediaries, and whether this distribution is solely determined by the smart contract, and whether the content of this smart contract conforms to the existing laws in royalties, intellectual properties. Figure 7: NFT Royalties: Clearly Explained How does the value or the function differ in different types of products, like patents, technology, books, or creative arts in terms of privacy, copyright, and ownership? This brings us to the first question: How to price an NFT? First, it is quite challenging to value NFTs since there are few comparable assets, and at the same time, NFT has enabled the unbundling ownership applicable. In the past, it is difficult to define the ownership of multiple agents on the same property, however, a clear and transparent identification of the smart contract fully illustrates the properties and their corresponding value to determine the price of an NFT ( Wil, 2021 ). In terms of pricing the NFT, here we summarize 6 features to be considered when determining its value: Chain Security . The chain an NFT is minted on contributes to and secures, its value over time, and this is why NFTs minted on Ethereum are currently more valuable than NFTs minted elsewhere. 2. On-chain or Off-Chain. It turns out that it is more valuable than Off-chain since the former one enables the metadata to be incorporated into the token, in order to make it last forever. 3. Creator and community\u2019s fame and reputation . Naturally, the more popular the creator, the bigger the community, the more valuable the NFT is \u2014 and this dynamic is basically true for any market. 4. Scarcity and authenticity go hand-in-hand with scarcity. Any party purchasing an NFT should conduct due diligence of scarcity and authenticity. For a low transaction fee, anyone can create an NFT, with a number of copies, that purports to represent something important, but these NFTs have no authenticity or scarcity, and thus have low value. 5. Release Pace . It is important to figure out the production pace of a given kind of NFT. With a simple example, one provider that offers unlimited mints of an NFT at 0.1 is generally not as attractive as one that is committed to minting only 50 NFTs, even with a limited supply. 6. Richness , related to additional features of an NFT. More and more visual NFTs are now minted with accompanying audio. Compared to a plain old NFT, it offers users a richer artistic experience, which adds to its value to a large extent. Here are also several examples of Value Transfer to NFT: In May 2021, The \u00a370,000 artwork, called Morons, was destroyed and made into a non-fungible token. According to the buyer Injective Protocol , this behavior is intended to be the first trial where a physical piece is turned into a digital one. And the idea is that \u201cby removing the physical piece from existence and only having the NFT, we can ensure that the NFT, due to the smart contract ability of the blockchain, will ensure that no one can alter the piece and it is the true piece that exists in the world. By doing this, the value of the physical piece will then be moved onto the NFT\u201d ( Shaw, 2021 ). Later, its NFT is minted in Ethereum, and its value increases sharply in the Decentralized Artwork Gallery. Figure 8: NFT\u2019s Street Later, in August 2021, a Macroeconomist is heading to make it happen that the physical value of a diamond can be transferred to NFT after it is destroyed in the physical world. This experiment is still in progress, and we can see in the OpenSea that its value now is far above the floor price, and it has increased by over 1000%. To help understand why this transfer can still sustain the value of the original destroyed one, we can make a comparable example here, in terms of a physical asset, it has value because of two functions ( LizerbramLaw, 2021 ): Physical utilities function Asset function as a Store-of-Value (SoV) [8] An NFT can serve the role as an SoV because it\u2019s able to satisfy 3 basic criteria for something to qualify as an \u201casset\u201d: Durability; Limit on supply; Social agreement. After the transfer behavior takes place, we have to recalculate its price by following steps: Find the price of the corresponding physical asset Subtract the values of its physical features Add the values of digital-asset features of the NFT, such as programmability, low maintenance, security, trackable, ownership verifiable, etc. From the example above, we figure out that there is a great distinction between NFT and other physical assets. To be more specific, for the physical assets, the NFT smart contract has to be aligned with the legal contract associated with the physical assets in reality to avoid confusion. Another Outlook on Book NFT From Buyer\u2019s Perspective: Understand digital copies of books available on Amazon as an example and comparative study with NFT. For the e-book you bought on Amazon or other centralized e-book shelves, As long as Amazon is existed and agrees to continue to provide it, you can own it. If Amazon crashes tomorrow, that book will disappear with other platforms. From this perspective, NFT has more in common with printed books-it is your property, full stop. It will not disappear due to the whim of outside parties. In fact, with NFT, you not only own one copy, but you also own a specific copy of a series of copies. But what buyers on earth can get after the transaction on the Book NFT Platform? (1) the NFT itself (which can be re-sold); (2) the ebook file redemption code; (3) an optional print copy if they want it at no extra cost. Platforms for selling Book NFT and in which segment you can sell two existing bookselling NFT Platform, one is Canonic , built upon Bitcoin Blockchain; and the other is WIP Publishing , minted to the Ethereum or MATIC blockchain, Polygon. Sell the cover art as an NFT Release the book in chapters sold as NFTs Sell the entire PDF manuscript Make a book trailer and mint the images Figure 9: Canonic Website Canonic is actually a great example but it only allows reviews from those who purchased the book, and Canonic\u2019s service attempts to eliminate book-burning, similar to how service providers de-platform content creators based on their political views. WIP Publishing is designed to minimize fees and maximize returns for authors to fully motivate writers to produce more valuable content and materials, and at the same time, it allows the buyers to directly make payment in OpenSea conveniently. From Author\u2019s Perspective: Compared to Traditional Publisher Publishing, such as Wiley , NFT book publishing actually gets rid of the intermediaries and further brings more financial profits to the authors themselves. This would in turn generate a stronger motivation for the writer to produce more valuable books and publishing materials with high quality. In addition, we notice that self-publishing platforms, such as Pressbooks , are available for authors who would like to publish their works as an open-source e-book or physical book, with ISBN and DOI numbers available, to guarantee authors\u2019 intellectual property. However, for the NFT book, it can be foreseen that smart contracts designed in these platforms could not only enable authors to track whether there is any illegitimate use through decentralized blockchain and guarantee all the financial profits they deserve through on-chain transactions. In addition, NFT also helps in getting rid of piracy and plagiarism. Every sale or purchase generates a data entry stored in blockchain technology, and every time the ownership of a book is transferred, it will be recorded in the blockchain, and royalties will be paid and collected systematically ( Rolling State, 2021 ). Cryptocurrency and blockchain technology becomes all the more fun when you are able to remove your real-world identity from your wallet ID. NFTs for books could enable any author or publisher to receive compensation for their work while being completely anonymous ( Upadhydy, 2021 ). And In the future, a secondary benefit is NFTs could allow the writers to monetize the secondhand book market, which further expands the monetization of the core product. Conclusion In this article, we explore the sea of NFT from a legal perspective, and this hopefully helps you to generate a holistic view of the current situation with this hot topic and implies several orientations for us to move forward to generate research questions related. The reason why we put a great number of efforts into the US-legal perspective is that we mainly focus on the marketplace who are the ones that get most involved, and clearly, the US is now a leading player. But in the meanwhile, we notice that there are more activities now emerging in European countries and China, and for example, MiCA is now heading to draft a proposal for the EU\u2019s Proposed Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation. Thus, we are also more than excited to see researchers, who are interested in, to do comparative studies in the future.

NFTs can be used to represent easily-reproducible items such as photos, videos, audio, and other types of digital files as unique items, and use blockchain technology to establish a verified and public proof of ownership. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-fungible_token [2] Ownership Ownership is the legal right to use, possess, and give away a thing. Ownership can be tangible such as personal property and land, or it can be of intangible things such as intellectual property rights. https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/ownership [3] Intellectual Property Intellectual property (IP) is a category of property that includes intangible creations of the human intellect. There are many types of intellectual property, and some countries recognize more than others. The most well-known types are copyrights, patents, trademarks, and trade secrets. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_property [4] Copyfraud A copyfraud is a false copyright claim by an individual or institution with respect to content that is in the public domain. Copyfraud also includes overreaching claims by publishers, museums, and others, as were a legitimate copyright owner knowingly, or with constructive knowledge, claims rights beyond what the law allows. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyfraud [5] infringement An infringement refers to the unauthorized use of a copyrighted or patented invention. https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/infringement [6] Financial Action Task Force (FATF) FATF is an intergovernmental organization founded in 1989 to develop policies to combat money laundering and has recently issued global, binding standards to prevent the misuse of virtual assets for money laundering and terrorist financing. https://www.fatf-gafi.org/ [7] Royalties A royalty is a payment made by one party to another that owns a particular asset, for the right to ongoing use of that asset. Royalties are typically agreed upon as a percentage of gross or net revenues derived from the use of an asset or a fixed price per unit sold of an item of such, but there are also other modes and metrics of compensation. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royalty_payment [8] Store of Value (SoV) A Store of Value (SoV) is any commodity or asset that would normally retain purchasing power into the future and is the function of the asset that can be saved, retrieved, and exchanged at a later time, and be predictably useful when retrieved. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Store_of_value","title":"Explore the sea of NFT"},{"location":"articles/Research/ExploretheseaofNFT/#explore-the-sea-of-nft","text":"- A US-Legal Perspective An NFT [1] is a digital asset that can stand for real-world objects, such as art, music, photos or videos, items in the games, and even books. They can be minted, bought, and sold on a certain marketplace. You might wonder what would be the difference between the NFT and cryptocurrency: that is, one of its remarkable properties is that it is actually a unique unit of data stored on a digital ledger that is not interchangeable ( Trautman, 2021 ). However, it is still a mystery whether we should treat NFT as a commodity or a new item to be defined in this new decentralized world, and how we can apply those existing US Laws to identify its corresponding properties in order to regulate NFT market behavior, thus maintaining the blockchain ecology.

However, in the real life, it is difficult to determine whether the owner of that photograph would own underlying intellectual property rights, for example, making copies, printing, or creating other derivative works if he/she actually obtained that NFT from a transaction ( Bain et al., 2021 ). From this point of view, we propose that they have the right to own, sell, lend, or otherwise transfer the NFT itself, nonetheless, they don\u2019t have the right to make or sell copies of the digital art, to transfer the copyright in the work, or to create derivative works based on the original, unless a \u201cwritten\u201d copyright transfer is done (We will further talk about the copyright transfer in Part 2).","title":"Unique Ownership"},{"location":"articles/Research/ExploretheseaofNFT/#ownership-and-underlying-intellectual-property-rights","text":"The ownership [2] of NFT as a unique digital asset against ownership of the actual content that the NFT is connected to requires clear discrimination. In other words, an NFT is minted and created to represent the work of art or other productions behind, but it does not mean that any subsequent buyer and owner of the NFT would automatically own other underlying intellectual property [3] rights, among which the copyright is especially dominant. When someone purchases an NFT linked to several contents, they do not directly mean to purchase the underlying intellectual property rights ( Mahmood, 2021 ). NFT is nothing but a non-fungible unique cryptographic token. Under Section 14 of the Copyright Act , \u201ca copyright owner has certain exclusive rights to reproduce, prepare adaptations of a work, perform, display, and distribute the copyrighted works in public\u201d. According to this article, we would claim that for any original works, the author should own the copyright, except that the author is hired to make these contents, and there are other contracts signed by the two sides to note the belonging of the copyright explicitly. And in the general case, there is a common sense that the purchase behavior itself does not mean to transfer all copyright to the buyers ( Stim, 2019 ). If the NFT owner is explicitly permitted by the seller that some of the intellectual property rights are transferred, the NFT owner is not allowed to make use of the elements in the creative work adhered to the NFT and create copies in order to distribute in any form to the public. If you are still confused about how these different concepts relate or differ, here is a vivid example for you to understand: The NFT of the American celebrity basketball player LeBron James\u2019 dunk video was released as the limited-edition digital collectors that are sold on the \u201cTop Shot\u201d market. It turns out that the card describing a dunk can sell with lots of money, but NBA still reserves the copyright to the original video, as well as any future reproduction of the video rights. Therefore, for the owner of the NBA NFT, it is possible to display the image in a certain way but still must not change the video moments captured in your NFT or sell anything related to your NFT without the prior consent of the NBA. Commodities are used for any commercial purpose. In addition, all license terms set by the owner of the underlying intellectual property rights shall be complied with ( Young, 2021 ). Figure 2: Intellectual Property In order to avoid being stuck in potential trouble caused by misunderstanding or neglect, developers ought to overcome these shortcomings since these can be mitigated with either the technology itself or through suitable wordings in the Assignment/license/intellectual property transfer smart contracts associated with the NFT. That is to say, if there is a mechanism within the NFT platform to create custom made smart contracts that could draw the line as to the originality of the assets, the rights conferred, royalties, if any, etc., then the problems associated with the market regarding intellectual property infringement associated with the sale of NFTs could be brought down. In addition, the introduction of necessary demarcation of rights and liabilities for a creative art buyer with implications of the potential creation of NFT would help the buyer sell the work in an NFT marketplace in the future. Now that we have a clear understanding of how the differences between ownership and intellectual property look, we are also curious about if someone misunderstood their relationship, how will copyfraud and infringement have an impact on the blockchain ecology?","title":"Ownership and Underlying Intellectual Property Rights"},{"location":"articles/Research/ExploretheseaofNFT/#how-to-avoid-copyfraud-and-improve-the-transparency-and-legitimacy-of-nft-assets-transfer","text":"","title":"How to avoid copyfraud and improve the transparency and legitimacy of NFT assets transfer?"},{"location":"articles/Research/ExploretheseaofNFT/#copyfraud-and-infringement-of-copyright","text":"From the last section, we notice that it is quite difficult to differentiate between ownership and other intellectual properties in the NFT, especially for ordinary people. Therefore, the minting and sale in the marketplace are vulnerable to \u2018copyfraud\u2019 [4] and the infringement [5] of the copyright of the basic work and moral rights. Copyfraud often occurs when a person mints an NFT of a public domain work, falsely claims to own the copyright. Similarly, if a person is not the author or copyright owner of the underlying assets for which copyright exists, casting NFTs and misrepresenting them as the author or copyright owner of the work may infringe copyright and moral rights ( Lewis et al., 2021 ). We have seen an instance of works in the public domain from the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam that were turned into an NFT. Another one is about a 12-year-old programmer named Benyamin Ahmed who launched his own NFT project. His 3,350 computer-generated \u201cWeird Whales\u201d almost instantly sold out for 3 ETH each ($6,000). However, while this hype took place, one user found that the artwork \u201cpixel whale\u201d seemed to be copied directly from another pr o ject , using pixel images from four years ago ( Schmalfeld, 2021 ). However, we are still not clear whether the artwork \u201cWeird Whales\u201d project improperly makes use of others\u2019 intellectual property rights, since that base image may have been placed in the public domain and the original artist may have announced explicit permission for anyone to use. \u201cCopyfraud, as the term is used in this Article, refers to claiming falsely a copyright in a public domain work. These false copyright claims, which are often accompanied by threatened litigation for reproducing a work without the putative \u201cowner\u2019s\u201d permission, result in users seeking licenses and paying fees to reproduce works that are free for everyone to use, or altering their creative projects to excise the uncopyrighted material.\u201d( Jason Mazzone, 2006 ) Figure 3: Copyfraud Meanwhile, we are also seeing some artists start complaining about social media that their works were being minted into NFTs without their permission. It turns out that the physical asset is not on the blockchain, but the token itself has been in. This means that access to this item depends on whether the site hosting is online or not. When the seller of the NFT is not the true holder of the copyright, the problems of copyfraud and copyright infringement raise. At the same time, similar issues happen in stock image libraries, where their terms may require anyone uploading images to have the necessary copyrights, but anyone who has access to high-resolution images that are attractive to others can still try your luck and submit this image to profit from any sales ( Golowczynski, 2021 ). Why does the infringement issue show up? Let\u2019s delve into the loophole behind NFT: One advantage to purchasing an NFT is that all authentication is done on the blockchain. As long as the buyer is eligible to confirm that the original selling account can be successfully linked to the artist, then no matter how many rounds this item has been in the transaction, the buyer can still verify whether the purchased piece is authentic ( Schmalfeld, 2021 ). However, what the blockchain does not explicitly inform the buyer is whether the piece of work is simply a copy of one\u2019s intellectual property or not. Thus, we would assert that constructing a centralized administrative mechanism for identifying the public domain/true owners, like storing copyright into government-leading databases, might be a resolution to contain the copyfraud/infringement of copyright.","title":"Copyfraud and infringement of copyright:"},{"location":"articles/Research/ExploretheseaofNFT/#the-legitimacy-of-nft-assets-transfer","text":"Some platforms offer to build in copyright elements into the sale, such as copyright transfer; Mintable for example includes a tick-box that allows the person minting a work to \u201cTransfer Copyright\u201d. ( Guadamuz, 2021 ) Figure 4: Copyright Transfer interface in Mintable(an NFT market shop) With regards to the transfer of copyright, Copyright Law of the United States establishes copyright assignment as requiring that \u201cany or all of the copyright owner\u2019s exclusive rights, or parts of those rights, can be transferred. The transfer, however, generally must be made in writing and signed by the owner of the rights conveyed or the owner\u2019s authorized agent.\u201d In the widest sense, an assignment of copyright means that the ownership of work will be transferred to the assignee, and they can therefore do with the work as they want. So you might ask whether the design of the Copyright Transfer Interface is applicable and legitimate? With regards to the use of a tick box to generate a copyright assignment, this could be akin to what is known as a click-wrap agreement, namely legal documents that are usually entered into by the click of a button. This is a widely accepted practice, and there is substantial case law accepting the use of \u201cI Agree\u201d click buttons. It would appear that as long as it is clear that the party is willing to make a copyright assignment according to what they \u201csay and do\u201d, then the ticking of a box, the filling of a form, and the signing of a token electronically could all be taken together to evidence the existence of an assignment. Thus, it allows a more personalized realization of transferring all or part of the copyright in the smart contract. First of all, we should be aware that, when it comes to copyright, we\u2019re actually talking about multiple rights. It includes the right of reproducing, selling, licensing, or otherwise transferring the copyright of the original work, as well as making derivative works. Here is an example for Music Contracts : \u201cWith respect to music minted into an NFT, you could draft the associated smart contract with provisions that provide performance rights only to the purchaser of the NFT while retaining all other rights for the artist, who could then sell one of those other rights (such as the synch rights) to a different purchaser of a separate NFT. The open nature of the blockchain means it is relatively easy to track these various rights as they pass from party to party and makes tracking any associated royalty streams relatively easy compared to current standards\u201d ( Barsky, 2021 ).","title":"The legitimacy of NFT assets transfer"},{"location":"articles/Research/ExploretheseaofNFT/#but-what-does-in-writing-and-signed-mean-exactly-to-ensure-its-legitimacy","text":"It is accepted widely that electronic documents can be used to conduct contracts. Although the ESIGN Act is a federal law, if all parties to the contract use electronic documents and sign electronically, electronic signatures and records will be legally recognized.

This means that in practical terms there is a wide range of types of signatures being accepted as valid by the courts. While existing rules are broad and inclusive to various electronic formats, it\u2019s not yet clear if this could include the type of cryptographic signature that is used to sign an NFT. Also, the formal validity of smart contracts as contracts is still in heated debate. However, there has been a recent consultation by the UK Jurisdiction Taskforce looking specifically at cryptographic assets such as tokens, and they believe that there is no reason to believe that private-key signatures would not be classed as electronic signatures for any legal purpose. The recognition of NFT assets transfer acting as valid forms of transferring rights represents the general trends. Still, there is nothing stopping an author from using both an NFT to transfer ownership of a digital asset electronically, while writing a document in natural language and with a physical signature to ensure the buyer that there has been a proper transfer of rights. This is the preferred solution of some platforms that are offering copyright transfer as part of their services.

Or what is the merit of NFT that the latter one does not possess, which puts all of us into a frenzy nowadays? The transparency of NFTs is the answer we are increasingly hearing to those questions recently. On one hand, the \u201cphysical\u201d art world is largely based on the opacity of art transaction information. The past auction house sales are the only reliable public evidence that sets the estimate of value for artworks. Conversely, NFTs are transparent in the sense that no one is capable of manipulating the record of ownership or copying a new NFT. To a certain extent, the transparency associated with the Ethereum blockchain and digital art allows us to track every transaction, which is a key element in the field of innovative art. For example, if you trace down the transaction of the one digital art collector NFT called @4156 buying the work \u201cDeath Dip\u201d by the artist XCOPY on the SuperRare platform for the sum of 1,735,000 dollars, then at that moment the balance of the digital wallets is approximately 769.55 ETH ($1,667,741) in that of the artist and 301.31 ETH ($653,757) ( Concas, 2021 ). With their wallet address, it is easy to further track the subsequent input and output transactions.

( Cornelius, 2021 ). Traditional Internet Companies depend on centralized intermediaries to verify personal data. For example, Google utilizes an authentication service to verify user data and offers protection policies to ensure user privacy. In comparison, NFTs transactions manifest great advantages. NFTs transactions can be made directly between buyer and seller using smart contracts where personal information is directly shared with third parties. Using blockchain technology, creating identity mechanisms becomes possible for verifying and collecting necessary data in a decentralized manner, without ever sharing it directly with counterparties. Thus, NFTs guarantee user anonymity by storing personal data into non-fungible tokens that interact directly with smart contracts. However, the anonymity features of NFTs also bring about regulation problems, such as nefarious money laundering issues. Because digital art is both newer and more subjective in pricing because collectors and financiers are struggling with a series of new issues that revolve around the value of the artwork if it can never be actually viewed or stored. This creates a perfect environment for crime because dealers and sellers can determine the value of a work and compare prices with little historical background. Therefore, it is an excellent cover for money laundering, adding more confidentiality to an already challenging market, where location, identity, and source of funds are usually kept secret.

NFT royalties are automatically paid to the author in the second sale. They are encoded into smart contracts on the blockchain. Every time a second sale occurs, the smart contract will ensure that the terms of the NFT are fulfilled. If royalties are specified, part of the profits will go to the artist who created them ( Gomezz, 2021 ). The prerequisite for generating NFT is that it must be specifically identified in the articles. Whenever the smart contract terms are written clearly, the remaining will be processed automatically. Although traditionally after the first sale, artists or creators cannot track subsequent transactions of their works ( Chernichaw et al., 2021 ). Once they sell their work, all their income will come from that work. No matter how the reputation has increased in the future, they cannot get any other benefits sold before. On the other hand, if they wait for the right time, buyers of their works can regret and further sell the same work at a higher price. This resulted in artists being unable to get a cent from subsequent sales, no matter how high their prices were. Therefore, the common concept of artists is that of poor or hungry artists. NFT brings the opportunity to completely change this situation. Artists can get a permanent fair share of their work.","title":"What are NFT royalties?"},{"location":"articles/Research/ExploretheseaofNFT/#why-are-nft-royalties-important","text":"NFT royalties are a quite easy way and a good opportunity for artists, composers, and other original content creators to profit from their original work, and this might be quite difficult to happen in the traditional item in real-life ( Chernichaw et al., 2021 ). NFT is actually a way to democratize payment. Now, based on popularity, celebrities can get paid as easily as sports superstars. They also benefit from the secondary sale of their works, which is fair. Another cool thing about NFT is that the tokens can be sold, but the basic copyright still belongs to the creator. Authors now can even separate the intellectual properties into different segments and thus sell a certain percentage to potential buyers. Since NFT Royalties develop a new function that whenever one NFT is resold, according to the presets of smart contract, part of the royalties will follow the flow to send back to the creation (intellectual property owners). However, there is still a grey area that there is no mechanism/law to regulate how royalties will be distributed among creators, owners, and other intermediaries, and whether this distribution is solely determined by the smart contract, and whether the content of this smart contract conforms to the existing laws in royalties, intellectual properties.

In the past, it is difficult to define the ownership of multiple agents on the same property, however, a clear and transparent identification of the smart contract fully illustrates the properties and their corresponding value to determine the price of an NFT ( Wil, 2021 ). In terms of pricing the NFT, here we summarize 6 features to be considered when determining its value: Chain Security . The chain an NFT is minted on contributes to and secures, its value over time, and this is why NFTs minted on Ethereum are currently more valuable than NFTs minted elsewhere. 2. On-chain or Off-Chain. It turns out that it is more valuable than Off-chain since the former one enables the metadata to be incorporated into the token, in order to make it last forever. 3. Creator and community\u2019s fame and reputation . Naturally, the more popular the creator, the bigger the community, the more valuable the NFT is \u2014 and this dynamic is basically true for any market. 4. Scarcity and authenticity go hand-in-hand with scarcity. Any party purchasing an NFT should conduct due diligence of scarcity and authenticity. For a low transaction fee, anyone can create an NFT, with a number of copies, that purports to represent something important, but these NFTs have no authenticity or scarcity, and thus have low value. 5. Release Pace . It is important to figure out the production pace of a given kind of NFT. With a simple example, one provider that offers unlimited mints of an NFT at 0.1 is generally not as attractive as one that is committed to minting only 50 NFTs, even with a limited supply. 6. Richness , related to additional features of an NFT. More and more visual NFTs are now minted with accompanying audio. Compared to a plain old NFT, it offers users a richer artistic experience, which adds to its value to a large extent. Here are also several examples of Value Transfer to NFT: In May 2021, The \u00a370,000 artwork, called Morons, was destroyed and made into a non-fungible token. According to the buyer Injective Protocol , this behavior is intended to be the first trial where a physical piece is turned into a digital one. And the idea is that \u201cby removing the physical piece from existence and only having the NFT, we can ensure that the NFT, due to the smart contract ability of the blockchain, will ensure that no one can alter the piece and it is the true piece that exists in the world. By doing this, the value of the physical piece will then be moved onto the NFT\u201d ( Shaw, 2021 ). Later, its NFT is minted in Ethereum, and its value increases sharply in the Decentralized Artwork Gallery. Figure 8: NFT\u2019s Street Later, in August 2021, a Macroeconomist is heading to make it happen that the physical value of a diamond can be transferred to NFT after it is destroyed in the physical world. This experiment is still in progress, and we can see in the OpenSea that its value now is far above the floor price, and it has increased by over 1000%. To help understand why this transfer can still sustain the value of the original destroyed one, we can make a comparable example here, in terms of a physical asset, it has value because of two functions ( LizerbramLaw, 2021 ): Physical utilities function Asset function as a Store-of-Value (SoV) [8] An NFT can serve the role as an SoV because it\u2019s able to satisfy 3 basic criteria for something to qualify as an \u201casset\u201d: Durability; Limit on supply; Social agreement. After the transfer behavior takes place, we have to recalculate its price by following steps: Find the price of the corresponding physical asset Subtract the values of its physical features Add the values of digital-asset features of the NFT, such as programmability, low maintenance, security, trackable, ownership verifiable, etc. From the example above, we figure out that there is a great distinction between NFT and other physical assets. To be more specific, for the physical assets, the NFT smart contract has to be aligned with the legal contract associated with the physical assets in reality to avoid confusion.","title":"This brings us to the first question: How to price an NFT?"},{"location":"articles/Research/ExploretheseaofNFT/#another-outlook-on-book-nft","text":"From Buyer\u2019s Perspective: Understand digital copies of books available on Amazon as an example and comparative study with NFT. For the e-book you bought on Amazon or other centralized e-book shelves, As long as Amazon is existed and agrees to continue to provide it, you can own it. If Amazon crashes tomorrow, that book will disappear with other platforms. From this perspective, NFT has more in common with printed books-it is your property, full stop. It will not disappear due to the whim of outside parties. In fact, with NFT, you not only own one copy, but you also own a specific copy of a series of copies. But what buyers on earth can get after the transaction on the Book NFT Platform? (1) the NFT itself (which can be re-sold); (2) the ebook file redemption code; (3) an optional print copy if they want it at no extra cost. Platforms for selling Book NFT and in which segment you can sell two existing bookselling NFT Platform, one is Canonic , built upon Bitcoin Blockchain; and the other is WIP Publishing , minted to the Ethereum or MATIC blockchain, Polygon. Sell the cover art as an NFT Release the book in chapters sold as NFTs Sell the entire PDF manuscript Make a book trailer and mint the images Figure 9: Canonic Website Canonic is actually a great example but it only allows reviews from those who purchased the book, and Canonic\u2019s service attempts to eliminate book-burning, similar to how service providers de-platform content creators based on their political views. WIP Publishing is designed to minimize fees and maximize returns for authors to fully motivate writers to produce more valuable content and materials, and at the same time, it allows the buyers to directly make payment in OpenSea conveniently. From Author\u2019s Perspective: Compared to Traditional Publisher Publishing, such as Wiley , NFT book publishing actually gets rid of the intermediaries and further brings more financial profits to the authors themselves. This would in turn generate a stronger motivation for the writer to produce more valuable books and publishing materials with high quality. In addition, we notice that self-publishing platforms, such as Pressbooks , are available for authors who would like to publish their works as an open-source e-book or physical book, with ISBN and DOI numbers available, to guarantee authors\u2019 intellectual property. However, for the NFT book, it can be foreseen that smart contracts designed in these platforms could not only enable authors to track whether there is any illegitimate use through decentralized blockchain and guarantee all the financial profits they deserve through on-chain transactions. In addition, NFT also helps in getting rid of piracy and plagiarism. Every sale or purchase generates a data entry stored in blockchain technology, and every time the ownership of a book is transferred, it will be recorded in the blockchain, and royalties will be paid and collected systematically ( Rolling State, 2021 ). Cryptocurrency and blockchain technology becomes all the more fun when you are able to remove your real-world identity from your wallet ID. NFTs for books could enable any author or publisher to receive compensation for their work while being completely anonymous ( Upadhydy, 2021 ). And In the future, a secondary benefit is NFTs could allow the writers to monetize the secondhand book market, which further expands the monetization of the core product.","title":"Another Outlook on Book NFT"},{"location":"articles/Research/ExploretheseaofNFT/#conclusion","text":"In this article, we explore the sea of NFT from a legal perspective, and this hopefully helps you to generate a holistic view of the current situation with this hot topic and implies several orientations for us to move forward to generate research questions related.

In this article, I will focus on the financial services and investment in the NFT marketplace, which include NFT-collateralized lending, NFT collective investment schemes, and NFT insurance. The article will give a brief view of NFT finance and the future of the NFT market. NFT-collateralized lending: Why NFTfi? Tangible assets like houses and cars have widely recognized value, which means people can not only sell them to buyers for cash but can also use them as collateral and receive loans from banks. In the past, this was not the case with digital assets. Holders of NFTs were unlikely to get money unless they sold their crypto punks or bored apes. This was a tough choice: give up your collection or give up the money you need. Such a situation discouraged many potential investors of NFTs: not everyone would spend thousands of dollars for a collection that did not have a recognized value. Now, NFTfi is changing the situation. Through NFT-collateralized loans, NFTfi not only offers a way to generate money upon NFT collections but also provides a new way of low-risk NFT investment ( \u201cNFTfi,\u201d n.d. ). Figure 1 shows the concise interface of NFTfi: borrowing and lending with a single click of your mouse Figure 1: NFTfi NFTfi allows borrowers to get other cryptocurrencies with NFTs as collaterals, and it functions just like a pawn shop or a bank loan. If an NFT holder does not want to give up his/her NFT collections but needs money, then NFTfi is a good choice. The amount of loans a borrower can get is approximately half of the value of the NFT which is used as collateral, and the annual interest rates vary between 15% and 80%( Wang 2021 ). The characteristics of NFTfi, then, are attractive to both borrowers and lenders. NFTfi can greatly encourage investors and facilitate the prosperity of the NFT market. For an investor, the property of investments that can be quickly turned into cash is a vital yardstick to judge whether the investment is stable or not. In other words, NFTs become more tangible when NFTfi exists. How does NFTfi function? NFTfi is a decentralized platform that connects borrowers and lenders directly. When borrowers\u2019 need fits the lender\u2019s will, they will reach an agreement upon a term. Then the NFT as collateral will be transferred from the borrower to an escrow account temporarily and the loan (ETH or other cryptocurrencies [2]) will be sent to the borrower\u2019s wallet. During the process, a smart contract will be generated. The borrower is expected to pay back the loan and the interest to the lender in the stated period. Otherwise, the NFT will be transferred to the lender for makeup. In most cases, the NFTs are even more attractive for lenders. An unpaid loan often allows the lender to get an NFT at about half of its price. In some extreme cases, lenders may even get an NFT worth ten times more than the loan they gave( \u201cHow a Lender Received a $340,000 NFT after a Loan Wasn\u2019t Repaid\u201d n.d. ). For investors, being lenders on NFTfi is like a risk-free investment with the possibility of making a great fortune overnight. Figure 2 shows the NFT loan interface, which has brief information about the loan including status, duration, and repayment. Figure 2: lenders received a $340,000 Arago NFT after an unpaid 3ETH loan. As of November 2021, over 2100 loans totaling more than $26.5 million in value have been executed on the platform, with their overall collateral ratio being around 150% and has a default risk of up to 20% ( \u201cNFTfi, an NFT Marketplace for Collateralized Loans, Raises $5 Million\u201d 2021 ). Compared with other Defi loans like ETH loans, it is a relatively low ratio. Most Defi loans have a collateral ratio of around 250% and up to 800%. And such a ratio is even compatible compared with traditional centralized finance, which usually has a ratio range between 125%-175% ( \u201cCollateralized Loans in DeFi\u201d n.d. ). NFT collective investment schemes NFT funds. When an investment field becomes extremely popular, funds related to the field will be raised to gather money from society and at the same time provide the public with a more stable way of investing. The NFT market is no exception, and there are several reasons. First, there are a considerable number of people who are interested in the NFT market but do not want to get their hands dirty or are simply inexperienced in the area. The fund is published to serve such needs and increase profit through the \u201cleverage of society\u201d. Second, not all NFTs are suitable for investment. Those NFTs with a high degree of popularity and appreciation space like bored apes and crypto punks often have very high prices, which makes them unaffordable for most investors. Besides, information on exclusive drops is also opaque to the public. The information is usually shared among private NFT clubs and not much information can be found online in advance. All these features make professional NFT funds attractive. By gaining a large amount of money, famous NFT fund managers like Sasha Fleyshman can have more choices in the market to choose those unique and rare NFTs for more profits ( Huang n.d. ). They also participate in the NFT community actively and gain information on new drops through various channels. Machine learning and analysis of transaction data are also used in NFT funds to increase revenue. NFT funds by wavegp have made use of these tools since early 2021 ( \u201cNFT Fund \u2014 Wave Financial\u201d 2021 ). So far, meta 4 and wavegp have already issued declarations to launch their NFT funds. For instance, the wave NFT fund (NFF), which \u201cincludes elements of the quickly emerging Metaverse[3] with gaming, sports, and generative art being the focus\u201d ( Financial n.d. ), seeks to invest in platforms, NFTs, and protocols. The NFFs inject fresh blood into both decentralized finance and the art market and lower the entrance barrier to the NFT marketplace. \u201cThis gives investors who don\u2019t necessarily want to buy NFTs themselves but want to have exposure to the asset class, a venue to do it,\u201d said Meta4\u2019s managing partner Brandon Buchanan. Figure 2, the real-time dashboard for an NFT stock, is just like the traditional stock market and people can purchase them at the current price. Figure 3: NFT stock price. NFT funds usually have an annual return rate of about 50%-76%, and they are usually relatively active and profitable compared with traditional centralized finance funds thanks to the quick development of the market. For example, the NFT fund launched by Bitwise Asset Management has returned about 26% in four months ( Ballentine and Hajric 2022 ). NFT price fluctuation What can affect the price of NFTs? There are several factors: utility, potential /future value, previous holders, and market recognition( Chang 2020 ). Although collective investment seldom requires the investors to make transactions, it can be beneficial to understand the reason for the NFT\u2019s price. For utility, it means what people can use the NFT for. For instance, in game finance (gamefi[4]), NFTs can be used in games. Those NFTs of powerful weapons can be very expensive. Besides, those NFTs by famous artists like Beeple and Pak that have special memorable meanings can have astonishing prices. Some NFTs may have great future value. Some NFTs are part of a group or come in limited amounts. These features can make the NFTs have an extremely high price. Previous holders also mean a lot. It can often be hard to find out who the previous holders were. But who can reject an NFT that was once held by Elon Mask or Google company? Finally, the price of an NFT is the value decided by the market. Those widely recognized products are likely to have a higher price and be more welcomed for collateralized loans. NFT insurance Why to insure your NFTs On March 15th, 2021, Michael Miraflor, who is a marketing and media strategist and has been collecting NFTs, claimed that some of his NFT assets had been stolen. \u201cSomeone stole my NFTs today on @niftygateway and purchased $10K++ worth of today\u2019s drop without my knowledge,\u201d he tweeted yesterday. \u201cNFTs were then transferred to another account\u201d (Luce 2021) , as the NFT market develops rapidly, such cases of NFTs being stolen have started to occur frequently. Hackers may hack the account you use to transfer your NFTs, and there can also be technical risks like broken links that may simply make the NFTs go missing. Other risks like people forgetting the passcode or having their storage devices damaged must also be taken into account. Actually, in the cryptocurrency market, tokens or coins being stolen is not a new thing. Since 2011, there have been more than $11 billion worth of Cryptocurrencies stolen in the transactions( \u201cCollateralized Loans in DeFi\u201d n.d. ). And the cost of some major theft cases (figure 4) can cause considerable loss. Figure 4: Notable cryptocurrency compromises. NFTs can often have high unit value, and as an immature market, their security measures are also under-developed. Such features make NFTs very attractive for digital thefts. And unlike traditional art pieces, NFTs do not often have a solid form, which makes protections toward NFTs much more limited. Therefore, it can be vital for people to take care of their NFTs with higher security awareness. However, it is not practical for most investors to implement technological means to avoid being robbed or losing their NFTs. As a consequence, NFT insurance is desperately in need. Future of the NFT insurance. Before we look into the future of NFT insurance, let\u2019s discuss the difficulty of ensuring an NFT. The biggest problem lies in evaluating an NFT. As mentioned before, the price of NFTs can fluctuate greatly, and the most reliable reference for the price of an NFT is its trading history. Such volatility of price makes NFTs difficult to insure. It is hard for the insurer to decide how much to charge and how much to compensate. Potential clients of NFT insurance are also limited. Marketplaces like Nifty gateway or Opensea do not need to hold tokens and they as a consequence do not need insurance. Digital artists\u2019 NFTs face less risk because they have not yet flowed into the market. Only those collectors will need such insurance, and some of them may simply turn to offline methods to store their collections. In the past, most insurance in the cryptocurrency market was centralized and off-chain. Companies provided storage services to keep investors\u2019 assets safe, which was called third-party professional cold storage insurance. The companies acted as centers to store codes and avoid physical loss of the code. However, insurance to protect against technical thefts or value fluctuations is still a blank area. Where does the future of NFT insurance lie? In my opinion, merely avoiding loss of storage is not enough. The future of NFT insurance lies in rejecting the risk of price change and hacking or technical fraud. \u201cNon-fungible tokens insurance (NFTs) will protect digital assets verified using blockchain technology against capital losses from theft or other malicious hacks.\u201d(\u201c Non-Fungible Tokens Insurance (NFTs) (2022)\u201d n.d .). However, until now, there are no NFT policies available for insurance companies to follow. And companies are waiting for policyholders to take steps to mitigate risk, but we believe after a certain period of development, there will be clear prices and procedures for investors to follow( \u201cNon-Fungible Tokens Insurance (NFTs) (2022)\u201d n.d. ). A conclusion. Non-fungible token brings a revolution to both Defi and the digital world through attaching property rights to almost everything in the digital world. As a vital part of the future of Defi, the financial service in the area will have great space to grow and develop. And investment in this area also leads to innumerable possibilities. The market is indeed immature so far, services like NFT insurances are still resting on the level of thought. But undoubtedly, the future of NFT finance is for us to imagine, build, and enjoy.

And such a ratio is even compatible compared with traditional centralized finance, which usually has a ratio range between 125%-175% ( \u201cCollateralized Loans in DeFi\u201d n.d. ).","title":"How does NFTfi function?"},{"location":"articles/Research/FinancialserviceandinvestmentintheNFTmarketPlace/#nft-collective-investment-schemes","text":"","title":"NFT collective investment schemes"},{"location":"articles/Research/FinancialserviceandinvestmentintheNFTmarketPlace/#nft-funds","text":"When an investment field becomes extremely popular, funds related to the field will be raised to gather money from society and at the same time provide the public with a more stable way of investing. The NFT market is no exception, and there are several reasons. First, there are a considerable number of people who are interested in the NFT market but do not want to get their hands dirty or are simply inexperienced in the area. The fund is published to serve such needs and increase profit through the \u201cleverage of society\u201d. Second, not all NFTs are suitable for investment. Those NFTs with a high degree of popularity and appreciation space like bored apes and crypto punks often have very high prices, which makes them unaffordable for most investors. Besides, information on exclusive drops is also opaque to the public. The information is usually shared among private NFT clubs and not much information can be found online in advance. All these features make professional NFT funds attractive. By gaining a large amount of money, famous NFT fund managers like Sasha Fleyshman can have more choices in the market to choose those unique and rare NFTs for more profits ( Huang n.d. ). They also participate in the NFT community actively and gain information on new drops through various channels. Machine learning and analysis of transaction data are also used in NFT funds to increase revenue. NFT funds by wavegp have made use of these tools since early 2021 ( \u201cNFT Fund \u2014 Wave Financial\u201d 2021 ). So far, meta 4 and wavegp have already issued declarations to launch their NFT funds. For instance, the wave NFT fund (NFF), which \u201cincludes elements of the quickly emerging Metaverse[3] with gaming, sports, and generative art being the focus\u201d ( Financial n.d. ), seeks to invest in platforms, NFTs, and protocols. The NFFs inject fresh blood into both decentralized finance and the art market and lower the entrance barrier to the NFT marketplace. \u201cThis gives investors who don\u2019t necessarily want to buy NFTs themselves but want to have exposure to the asset class, a venue to do it,\u201d said Meta4\u2019s managing partner Brandon Buchanan. Figure 2, the real-time dashboard for an NFT stock, is just like the traditional stock market and people can purchase them at the current price. Figure 3: NFT stock price. NFT funds usually have an annual return rate of about 50%-76%, and they are usually relatively active and profitable compared with traditional centralized finance funds thanks to the quick development of the market. For example, the NFT fund launched by Bitwise Asset Management has returned about 26% in four months ( Ballentine and Hajric 2022 ).","title":"NFT funds."},{"location":"articles/Research/FinancialserviceandinvestmentintheNFTmarketPlace/#nft-price-fluctuation","text":"What can affect the price of NFTs? There are several factors: utility, potential /future value, previous holders, and market recognition( Chang 2020 ). Although collective investment seldom requires the investors to make transactions, it can be beneficial to understand the reason for the NFT\u2019s price. For utility, it means what people can use the NFT for. For instance, in game finance (gamefi[4]), NFTs can be used in games. Those NFTs of powerful weapons can be very expensive. Besides, those NFTs by famous artists like Beeple and Pak that have special memorable meanings can have astonishing prices. Some NFTs may have great future value. Some NFTs are part of a group or come in limited amounts. These features can make the NFTs have an extremely high price. Previous holders also mean a lot. It can often be hard to find out who the previous holders were. But who can reject an NFT that was once held by Elon Mask or Google company? Finally, the price of an NFT is the value decided by the market.

Hackers may hack the account you use to transfer your NFTs, and there can also be technical risks like broken links that may simply make the NFTs go missing. Other risks like people forgetting the passcode or having their storage devices damaged must also be taken into account. Actually, in the cryptocurrency market, tokens or coins being stolen is not a new thing. Since 2011, there have been more than $11 billion worth of Cryptocurrencies stolen in the transactions( \u201cCollateralized Loans in DeFi\u201d n.d. ). And the cost of some major theft cases (figure 4) can cause considerable loss. Figure 4: Notable cryptocurrency compromises. NFTs can often have high unit value, and as an immature market, their security measures are also under-developed. Such features make NFTs very attractive for digital thefts. And unlike traditional art pieces, NFTs do not often have a solid form, which makes protections toward NFTs much more limited. Therefore, it can be vital for people to take care of their NFTs with higher security awareness. However, it is not practical for most investors to implement technological means to avoid being robbed or losing their NFTs. As a consequence, NFT insurance is desperately in need.","title":"Why to insure your NFTs"},{"location":"articles/Research/FinancialserviceandinvestmentintheNFTmarketPlace/#future-of-the-nft-insurance","text":"Before we look into the future of NFT insurance, let\u2019s discuss the difficulty of ensuring an NFT. The biggest problem lies in evaluating an NFT. As mentioned before, the price of NFTs can fluctuate greatly, and the most reliable reference for the price of an NFT is its trading history. Such volatility of price makes NFTs difficult to insure. It is hard for the insurer to decide how much to charge and how much to compensate. Potential clients of NFT insurance are also limited. Marketplaces like Nifty gateway or Opensea do not need to hold tokens and they as a consequence do not need insurance. Digital artists\u2019 NFTs face less risk because they have not yet flowed into the market. Only those collectors will need such insurance, and some of them may simply turn to offline methods to store their collections. In the past, most insurance in the cryptocurrency market was centralized and off-chain. Companies provided storage services to keep investors\u2019 assets safe, which was called third-party professional cold storage insurance. The companies acted as centers to store codes and avoid physical loss of the code. However, insurance to protect against technical thefts or value fluctuations is still a blank area. Where does the future of NFT insurance lie? In my opinion, merely avoiding loss of storage is not enough. The future of NFT insurance lies in rejecting the risk of price change and hacking or technical fraud. \u201cNon-fungible tokens insurance (NFTs) will protect digital assets verified using blockchain technology against capital losses from theft or other malicious hacks.\u201d(\u201c Non-Fungible Tokens Insurance (NFTs) (2022)\u201d n.d .). However, until now, there are no NFT policies available for insurance companies to follow. And companies are waiting for policyholders to take steps to mitigate risk, but we believe after a certain period of development, there will be clear prices and procedures for investors to follow( \u201cNon-Fungible Tokens Insurance (NFTs) (2022)\u201d n.d. ).","title":"Future of the NFT insurance."},{"location":"articles/Research/FinancialserviceandinvestmentintheNFTmarketPlace/#a-conclusion","text":"Non-fungible token brings a revolution to both Defi and the digital world through attaching property rights to almost everything in the digital world.

[Part 1 Business Briefings] \u2014Stories behind three typical paradigms: Steemit, Bihu, and Voice Executive summary about tokenized social media Nowadays, users have an increasing demand for decentralized platforms when censorship, privacy disclosure, and security of personal data are severely concerned in traditional social media. The innovative blockchain technology perfectly solves this dilemma by reducing the trust cost, protecting users\u2019 freedom of expression, and serving as a reliable framework of the peer-to-peer (P2P) network. Taking a further step, a few social media companies have introduced the token system into their platforms. Tokenized social media connects the platform and users through their consensus on the token value. Moreover, the token economy incentivizes users to contribute their intelligence to the virtual community and participate in on-chain governance. In this article, we will introduce three typical tokenized social media, Steemit, Bihu, and Voice, in facets of their business models, token design, as well as insightful analysis about its strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT). Finally, we will discuss how tokenized social media revolutionizes the online communication ecology and builds the future community of diversity and inclusion. L isten to the podcast on Buzzsprout .

[Whitepaper] [Website] [Weibo] [Home page] [WhitePaper] [Website] [GitHub] [Twitter] [BluePaper] [Website] [Instgram] [Twitter] [Facebook] We will picture a sweeping landscape about tokenized social media by introducing three typical decentralized social media through four articles with weekly updates. In Part I, we introduce the basic business information for three specified tokenized platforms, Steemit, Bihu, and Voice, in four facets of team compositions, partnership, technology, and fund sources. Figure 2: Week 1 Mindmap Part I Business Briefings Figure 3: Sketch of three representative tokenized social media 1. Steemit 1.1 What is Steemit? Steem is a blockchain database that supports building a community and enhancing social interaction through cryptocurrency rewards. Steem combines the concept of social media and the lessons learned in building a cryptocurrency and its community. In this product, Steem establishes a fair accounting system that can consistently reflect everyone\u2019s contribution. As a result, STEEM is the first cryptocurrency that accurately and transparently rewards countless individuals who make personal contributions to their community. The Steemit community provides the following services to its members: a. A source of curated news and commentary. b. A means to get high-quality answers to personalized questions. c. A stable cryptocurrency pegged to the U.S. dollar. d. Free payments. e. Jobs responsible for providing the above services to other members. 1.2 Team Steemit is a New York-based startup co-founded by Ned Scott, CEO, and Daniel Larimer, CTO. Daniel, who previously founded Bitshares , an industrial grade \u201ccrypto-equity\u201d and peer-to-peer distributed ledger, resigned to work on his next project, EOS , which provides secure access and authentication, permissioning, data hosting, usage management, and communication between the dApps and the Internet. Figure 4: Ned Scott, Steemit Founder & CEO 1.3 Partnership Figure 5: TRON Foundation (Beijing, China) 1.4 Technology Web Traffic by SEMrush \u00b9 Together With SEMrush, Steem designs network monitoring that provides a full view of the company\u2019s online performance, website traffic performance, traffic metrics of domains, and comparison of the traffic data of websites. Website Tech Stack by BuiltWith \u00b2 ; Company Tech Stack by G2 Stack Through the collaboration with BuiltWith and G2 Stack, Steem makes it easier for developers to find out the technology stack of any website. Create lists of websites and contacts by the technologies used. Dynamic fractional bandwidth reserve model Steem uses a dynamic fractional bandwidth reserve model instead of a traditional fee system where the blockchain automatically adjusts the network\u2019s reserve ratio\u00b3 during congestion times. Steem sets a target utilization that leaves enough room for short-term surges, and when the surges persist, the blockchain reduces the maximum bandwidth per share. Thus, anytime an individual user\u2019s moving average bandwidth exceeds the current network limit, their transaction delays until their average falls below the limit. Minimum account balance requirements to prevent Sybil attacks To discourage Sybil attacks, Steem sets a minimum account balance to make transactions that are typically as low as a dollar. This mechanism provides a better user experience than charging transaction fees, given that the opportunity cost of lost interest is a more acceptable cost to users than micro fees on every transaction. A hierarchical private key structure Steem constructs a hierarchical private-key structure to facilitate both low- and high-security transactions. Below are the three type of keys with increasing power in authority: 1. Posting keys: allow accounts to post, comment, edit, vote. 2. Active keys: further enable transferring funds, converting Steem Dollars, voting for witnesses, placing market orders. 3. Owner key: additionally, empower changing any key of an account and prove ownership during account recovery. Steem also uses a master password that encrypts all three keys and allows users to trust certain services to keep improper keys from being transferred across any servers. Token protocol: Smart Media Tokens (SMTs) The token protocol of SMTs have three key features: 1. Allow the creation of arbitrary tokens that aligns incentives between users in platforms with \u201clike\u201d or \u201cupvote\u201d based algorithms. 2. Empower websites to adopt sustainable revenue models using native tokens and the so-called Proof-of-Brain mechanisms. 3. Enables anyone to start earning money with low entry barriers by contributing their time to growing a community. 1.5 Fund Figure 6: Parallax Digital , United States Figure 7: Solidum Capital , Slovenia Figure 8: PECUNIO Cryptocurrency Fund , United Arab Emirates Figure 9: Advance.Fund , United Kingdom Figure 10: Asymmetry Asset Management , South Africa Figure 11: Fundamental Labs , China Figure 12: The Hive Index , Germany 2 Bihu 2.1 What is Bihu? Bihu is a vertical community of token investors driven by tokens. Here, all \u201cuser-generated contents\u201d are part of the token incentive system. Below are three key features: 1.User ID: to realize a transparent operation of the platform; 2. Blockchain token: KEY is the blockchain token of Bihu, representing the right to use Bihu and its surrounding ecology; 3. Token Economy: users\u2019 effort and contributions are rewarded. 2.2 Team Figure 13: Bin Lu, Bihu Founder & CEO Bin is a blockchain expert with a Ph.D. degree acquired from the US and a CFA certificate. He is the founder of Bit Fang Blockchain Research Club ( www.bitfarm.io ). He has a famous network name, \u201cBit Gollum\u201d. He has many years of experience in the US stock market. He was introduced to Bitcoin in 2010 and completed the Chinese translation of the first edition of Ethereum White Paper at the end of 2013. He is an early member of the Ethereum project team and currently engaged in research, development, and investment on the blockchain, including but not limited to Ethereum, secondary development based on Ethereum code, implementation of private chains, and federation chains, practical development of smart contracts and programmable assets. 2.3 Partnership Figure 14: Bihu Partners 2.4 Technology Bihu ID Bihu ID is an open-source, non-profit, blockchain-based autonomous identity system in which users own their private keys. Its mission is to protect user property, data, and privacy in the context of Web 3.0. The biggest difference between BithuID and traditional blockchain accounts is that Bithu ID enables users to retrieve the property and data in their accounts if losing their private keys. A centralized platform and decentralized token Due to the limit of blockchain technology, Bihu uses traditional techniques to build a centralized app, which has more extended functions, faster running speed, and a better user experience. The separation between use & storage Bihu separates the storage of and the use of KEY. This intelligent design solves the limitations of the current blockchain technology regarding transaction throughput, final transaction delay, and transaction cost. On the one hand, KEY is implemented by the ERC20 token standard through the Ethereum blockchain. On the other hand, the use requirements of the KEY are realized through the independent technical solutions of the Bihu platform. In the first stage, the function of KEY is realized in a centralized way. That is, the user sends the Key to the Bithu platform for centralized storage. Therefore, only a tiny percentage of KEY will be actually stored in the form of a \u201cwallet.\u201d In the second stage, the KEY is stored in the BithuID, where the user controls the private KEY. Then, the backstage of BithuID reversely observes the blockchain to obtain the usage data so that the KEY usage is separated from the storage. 3 Voice 3.1 What is Voice? Voice is a blockchain social media product based on EOSIO , which is created and used by users. Users can create, distribute, and discover good content on it to get Voice token rewards. Most of the value created by Voice will return to the community through Voice tokens. On Voice, all interactions between users are on the chain, open and transparent, and there are no hidden algorithms or opaque benefits. Furthermore, Voice intends to create a platform where there are no fake accounts and news. Voice believes users should commercialize their content and the value it generates, and the user should determine the cost of being paid attention to by the community. 3.2 Team Voice is a social marketplace for [Non-Fungible Tokens (NFT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-fungible_token#:~:text=A%20non%2Dfungible%20token%20(NFT,other%20types%20of%20digital%20files) that helps emerging creators get discovered. It is a privately held company founded in 2020 with approximately 200 employees, among which 134 are on LinkedIn. Headquartered in Brooklyn, it specialized in social media, online media, Information Technology, NFTs, Digital Art, and Marketplace. 3.3 Partnership and Affiliated Party block.one: Figure 15: block.one logo Blockchain startup block.one has opened its blockchain-powered social network Voice to limited public access with a promise to reward users for quality content. Voice is built on Block.one\u2019s EOSIO protocol is best known for the EOS token. EOSIO launched in 2018 with a promise of offering an operating system that allows scalable decentralized autonomous communities with the support of asynchronous smart contract communication. 3.4 Fund Crunchbase reports a total funding amount of $150USD by block.one . Figure 16: Crunchbase logo [1]: SEMrush is a software as a service (SaaS) company based in Boston that sells online visibility and marketing analytics software subscriptions. [2]: BuiltWith is a website profiler tool, and it can return all the technologies it can find on the pagel upon looking up a page. [3] Similar to the concept in macroeconomics, the adjustment of network\u2019s reserve ratio is aimed at making every user\u2019s bandwidth dynamic in order to adapt to the change of transaction volume.

Most of the value created by Voice will return to the community through Voice tokens. On Voice, all interactions between users are on the chain, open and transparent, and there are no hidden algorithms or opaque benefits. Furthermore, Voice intends to create a platform where there are no fake accounts and news. Voice believes users should commercialize their content and the value it generates, and the user should determine the cost of being paid attention to by the community. 3.2 Team Voice is a social marketplace for [Non-Fungible Tokens (NFT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-fungible_token#:~:text=A%20non%2Dfungible%20token%20(NFT,other%20types%20of%20digital%20files) that helps emerging creators get discovered.

In this article, we will introduce three typical tokenized social media, Steemit, Bihu, and Voice, in facets of their business models, token design, as well as insightful analysis about its strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT). Finally, we will discuss how tokenized social media revolutionizes the online communication ecology and builds the future community of diversity and inclusion. To recap, in Part 1 , we introduce briefly the three trending tokenized social media. Now in Part 2, let\u2019s take a closer look into the business model and conduct SWOT Analysis [1]. We are also providing strategic advice for further development. Part II The Business Model Analysis I. The business models To win market shares from traditional social media, blockchain start-ups should build up their business models, by considering both their clients\u2019 demands and expectations, as well as the product\u2019s profit margins. So let\u2019s dive into their business models to find out their similarities and disparities from their strengths. Figure 1: Mind map of business model analysis 1 Similarity a) Built on blockchain: no intermediary (and thus low cost), transparency, anonymity, exclusive ownership of data. DeFi applications do not need any intermediaries or arbitrators. The code specifies the resolution of every possible dispute, and the users maintain control over their funds at all times. This reduces the costs associated with providing and using these products and allows for a more frictionless financial system. b) User-incentivized ( Autofilter [2] ) Users receive tokens by registering, producing posts, liking/commenting posts, or watching advertisements. Information recommendation: Good posts (with high likes/comments) delivered to users c) Cash user attention; Alignment between the platform and users (ads) Traditionally, users are forced to view advertisements on centralized social media. All advertisement fees are obtained by the platform owners whereas users cannot benefit from the time they spent watching the ads. One major improvement of decentralized social media is to change the unequal position of the platform and users by rewarding tokens to those who watch the advertisements. For example, Bihu only took 55% of advertisement fees, the rest 45% is rewarded to users after watching an advertisement. Figure 2: Logo of Bihu, Steemit, and Voice 2 Disparities a) Bihu is subject to censorship and manipulation (because of its centralized platform and enforcement of Chinese laws/regulations), while Steemit and Voice are more decentralized. b) Steemit has low user-friendliness (complicated three-currency mechanism; anchoring mechanism of STEEM), while Bihu and Voice has a lower threshold as each of them only contains one currency and has a clear token structure. c) Bihu and Steemit have a weight mechanism in token distribution: those who own more tokens could receive a higher proportion of new tokens. However, the token delivery in Voice has nothing to do with current wealth. The content quality determines the number of tokens that the creators can acquire. II. SWOT analysis and strategic advice In this session, we apply SWOT analysis for comparative studies. Moreover, we provide strategic advice to further advance each decentralized social media. Figure 3: Diagram of SWOT about Steemit Figure 4: Diagram of SWOT about Bihu Figure 5: Diagram of SWOT about Voice 1. Strengths There is one common strength among these three different tokenized social media, which is summarized as \u201c User-incentivized\u201d , where users could receive corresponding tokens by registering, producing posts, liking/commenting posts, or watching advertisements. Besides, some distinct strengths are also covered in these social media, and the concrete information is shown below: Steemit 1. Safety and information privacy protection : This platform guarantees the exclusive ownership of data. 2. Approachable token design mechanism : The mining mechanism is generated through traditional community behavior. 3. User-friendly settings : Only to construct a simple and easy-to-remember account. Bihu 1. Safety and information privacy protection : This platform guarantees the exclusive ownership of data. 2. High homogeneity : Ads are used to maintain the alignment between the platform and users. Voice 1. Safety and information privacy protection : This platform guarantees the exclusive ownership of data. 2. Pure content directed : Voice tokens have no staking weight. 3. High Transparency : Voice is fully on-chain, and all user behaviors are on-chain, which is much easier to be governed. 2. Weaknesses Their strengths are alike, their weakness differs in the extent of centralization, token mechanism, and way of promotion. Steemit 1. Complicated token design mechanism : Differences between these three types of tokens always confuse people, and may result in the loss of the user group to a large extent. 2. Possible monopoly trend in the user group : The main share of STEEM is controlled by a small number of people, and the benefits of user posts are not directly linked to the quality of the article but those who own currencies, which would result in terrible problems of the community ecology. 3. Inappropriate and unequal functions of tokens : In this project, more tokens means higher voting weight, which results in a terrible opportunities inequality. Bihu 1. Lack of decentralized elements : This social media is still a relatively centralized platform application, where designers are still capable of monitoring and controlling the release of users\u2019 contents. 2. Undesirable token release mechanism : Lock-up mechanism would enhance the wealth gap on the basis of the time those clients enter this platform. 3. Hard Censorship : China is still monitoring the series of behaviors on a regular basis and lays emphasis on the centralized censorship system in this application.\u201d Voice Lack of creativity in User Interface (UI) : Its design is quite similar to that in the traditional social media platform. 2. Undesirable promotion strategy : It\u2019s hard for clients to get access to this social media with common proxies to know more about this platform. 3. Opportunities Though having the weaknesses above, there are fairly many opportunities that they can grasp to take their unique place in the market. Steemit Large amount of funds and high expectation from the investors : Steemit, as one of the origins of tokenized social media, is given high expectations from the investors, and expected to update based on its own inner strength of its business model. Bihu 1. Strong content thickness : In this community, blockchain fans could easily be attracted to share what to buy, as well as when to buy and sell with blockchain investment. 2. Raise awareness of the superiority of decentralized tokens : Application of decentralized token in social media apps in the China market has been more discussed in the academic than industry area. 3. Accumulate clients : Users tend to believe in the value and development of KEY, which combine the platform and users to be parallel on the same page. Voice 1. Purely content-oriented mechanism : Amount of token rewards mainly depends on the number of \u201c\u201dlikes\u201d\u201d and the number of readings, nothing to do with the number of tokens the user already holds. 2. Strong platform support : Official version of Voice will be based on EOS IO [3]. 4. Threats In terms of threats, we first observe that one principle from behavioral economics called the \u201c Availability heuristic \u201d [4] could be perceived as one of the most serious threats among three social media. This means that people are easy to be biased by blockchain hot, the direct value of tokens, as well as some benefit cases of existing users. Steemit Inaccurate estimation of contribution abilities of equity owners : Developers cannot accurately estimate the genuine contribution from every equity owner when it comes to decision-making processes and long-term development of the whole community. Bihu Inflate traffic value : Large user group provides base for advertisement, and it might cover some inherent problems in the system itself. Voice 1. Blockchain infrastructure : Developers still cannot maintain its transparency, trust, security, and they should also find a solution to combat systematic manipulation 2. More efficient fake account filters : Verification through the developing Know Your Customer System (KYC) would behave more stable and efficient than the existing algorithms. 3. Put forward more paths to attract users\u2019 attention : User attention is distributed in the form of smart tokens, so it is necessary to develop more paths to motivate the users in the community. 4. Improving community ecology : It is necessary to construct a better development team and community to evolve Voice products. 5. Strategic Advice Figure 6: Mind map of strategic advice Steemit 1. Improve User-friendliness experiences: Find a strategy to describe the complicated three-token mechanism or polish up this mechanism in a simpler way. 2. Avoid the possibility of wealth distribution imbalance: 1 in 1000 people account for more than 75% of Steem Power, which exacerbates the wealth gap, where the rich have a stronger right to speak, and results in an undesirable community ecology. Bihu 1. Improve the value ecology of the community : KEY is backed up with actual use value in the ecology. 2. Decentralize both the platform and the token : Now Bihu only has a decentralized token but the platform is still centralized as they claimed that the blockchain technology is not able to support high-speed computation that a social media platform requires. Voice 1. Innovate the user interface (UI) design : Create a unique UI to attract potential customers and clients. 2. Establish comparative strength : Highlight its unique strength compared to steemit when making promotions, intros, etc., otherwise people might be stuck in straightforward thinking that it is just derived from the previous version of tokenized social media. Notes [1] SWOT Analysis: SWOT stands for Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats, and so a SWOT Analysis is a strategy for assessing these four aspects of business product. Here we apply SWOT Analysis to facilitate a realistic, fact-based, data-driven look at the strengths and weaknesses of an organization, initiatives, or within its industry. [2] Autofilter: Due to the reward system embedded in the smart contract, the client group would spontaneously filter the convincing and quality information, thus it does not require upper governance to screen and examine specific contents, which creates an intelligent society ecology. [3] EOS IO: EOS IO is a highly performant open-source blockchain platform, built to support and operate safe, compliant, and predictable digital infrastructures. [4] Availability Heuristics The availability heuristic , also known as availability bias , is a mental shortcut that relies on immediate examples that come to a given person\u2019s mind when evaluating a specific topic, concept, method or decision. The availability heuristic operates on the notion that if something can be recalled , it must be important, or at least more important than alternative solutions which are not as readily recalled.

Tokenized social media connects the platform and users through their consensus on the token value. Moreover, the token economy incentivizes users to contribute their intelligence to the virtual community and participate in on-chain governance. In this article, we will introduce three typical tokenized social media, Steemit, Bihu, and Voice, in facets of their business models, token design, as well as insightful analysis about its strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT). Finally, we will discuss how tokenized social media revolutionizes the online communication ecology and builds the future community of diversity and inclusion. To recap, in Part 1 , we provide a brief introduction to three representative tokenized social media. In Part 2 , we conduct a SWOT analysis on the business model and provide further strategic advice. In Part 3, let\u2019s take a closer look into the token economy. Part 3 The Token Economy Token mechanisms are extremely important for these decentralized social media, where tokens are produced and distributed to the whole community in order to maintain clients\u2019 enthusiasm and activeness on the platforms. Now we will cover and describe these token designs of the three typical decentralized social media in the following five aspects: Figure 1: Mind map of Token Design Brief 1. Token distribution Figure 2: Mind map of Token distribution 1.1 STEEM (token of Steemit) Community members are rewarded with tokens including 50% in Steem Power and 50% in Steem Dollars. For STEEM: (1) Reward: 75% of the newly added steem each year will enter the reward, and the creators and screeners in the community will be given tokens through a special algorithm; (2) Dividend: 15% will be directly distributed to the community shareholders (those who hold the steem power); (3) Wage: 10% will be assigned to the witnesses of the packaged block (those who write the transaction record on the chain). For Steem Power: A more amazing article would obtain more Steem Power. Figure 3: Pie chart of Steemit token (STEEM) distribution 1.2 KEY (token of Bihu) The total amount of KEY is 100 billion, which is divided into 4 parts according to the white paper: incentive pool, promotion and operation pool, Bihu Foundation, and team options. (1) Incentive pool: 45 billion KEY, locked by the smart contract, 10% of balance is released every year. (2) Promotion and operation pool: 25 billion KEY. The early recommendation and reward plan is the most powerful. (3) Bihu Foundation: 25 billion KEY for technical development, operation subsidization, and maintenance costs. (4) Team option: 5 billion KEY, exercised in 5 years, with 1% exercised every year. Figure 4: Pie chart of Bihu token (KEY) distribution 1.3 VOICE (token of Voice) The total amount is unknown, and only registered users can hold VOICE tokens. There are two main token distribution channels: (1) General distribution: VOICE are given to new users when they sign in every day. (2) Extra distribution: Users receive tokens by watching ads, posting, commenting, liking, and reporting illegal/unauthorized posts. 2. Incentivization Mechanism Figure 5: Mind map of Incentivization Mechanism 2.1 Steemit You can use your bain to earn Steemit in two ways. (1) Author Rewards: When you publish a post or a comment and other users upvote it, you earn author rewards. (2) Curation Rewards: When another author publishes a post or comment and you determine it to be valuable enough to upvote it, you get rewarded a share of the value of your upvote as curation reward. 2.2 Bihu KEY tokens are given to users for actions: (1) Posting high-quality contents; (2) Finding high-quality contents (by liking and commenting); (3) Managing and cultivating excellent topic sections; (4) Watching advertisements. What can users do with KEY? (1) To purchase premium services on the platform; (2) To pay to attend special and knowledgeable events (e.g., Q&A); (3) To reward the articles or posts. 2.3 Voice VOICE tokens are given to users in the following scenarios: (1) Activeness reward Users can get VOICE tokens by registering, logging in Voice, speaking on or commenting on Voice, etc. (2) Content creation reward All users can post content, and the platform rewards users with tokens based on their feedback on that content. In contrast to Bihu where users who possess a larger amount of KEY will get more rewards when they create content and the content is recognized by the community, Voice only cares about the quality and popularity of the content, but has nothing to do with the size of the token shares. (3) Invitation reward Users can get VOICE when they invite other people to join the Voice community. Moreover, it can happen as long as users promote the platform or even the blockchain technology itself, and make contributions to the blockchain ecosystem behavior reward. (4) Ad-watching reward Users get paid when they watch an advertisement. 3. Token supply Figure 6: Mind map of Token supply In this Section, we briefly illustrate the token dynamics of decentralized social media platforms. Two reasons may lie behind Steemit and Voice\u2019s coin inflation. First, the platform can raise funds by creating new tokens, just like the central banks printing money. Second, these newly created tokens would be the source of rewards given to registered clients and their contributions to the virtual community. For example, Voice adds 10% new tokens into circulation every year. However, Bihu has restricted its token supply on a yearly or weekly basis. Bihu wants to encourage users to hold tokens and stay in the community. This can be explained with a classical model of demand and supply. When the token of Bihu, KEY, decreases in its amount, the upward-sloping supply curve shifts to the left. Then, the new intersection, which is higher than before, represents a greater value of the same token. As a result, users are more likely to hold KEY tokens and thus are more \u201cfaithful\u201d to the platform. Besides, as users all know that the price of KEY will be increasing due to the supply cut, they sell less and thus provide greater price stability. Bihu reduces token supply mainly by eliminating part of the advertisement revenues, also known as the \u201ccoin burning mechanism\u201d. Product companies pay a certain amount of tokens to Bihu for the chance to share their advertisements. Traditionally, in centralized social media, people are forced to watch advertisements. Ads consume people\u2019s time, energy, and patience, but benefit the audiences nothing in most cases. However, Bihu, as a tokenized social media, divides the advertisement fees into two parts. 45% fees are given to registered users who view the ads. The remaining 55% fees, instead of incorporating into the platform\u2019s assets, are sent to the black hole account for which address you can only send tokens in but cannot turn them out. Since 2021, Bihu has burnt 80% of the balance of the incentive pool on a weekly basis. 4. On-chain Governance Steemit has an on-chain governance mechanism: Steem Power holders are tasked through on-chain voting. Witnesses are also responsible for voting on changes to the consensus rules (i.e. hard forks). If token holders do not believe that a particular witness or group of witnesses are performing their duties properly, they will unvote them and vote in new witnesses to take their place. Meanwhile, no official documents or public resources clearly indicate that Bihu and Voice has a definite on-chain governance structure. 5.

The innovative blockchain technology perfectly solves this dilemma by reducing the trust cost, protecting users\u2019 freedom of expression, and serving as a reliable framework of the peer-to-peer (P2P) network. Taking a further step, a few social media companies have introduced the token system into their platforms. Tokenized social media connects the platform and users through their consensus on the token value. Moreover, the token economy incentivizes users to contribute their intelligence to the virtual community and participate in on-chain governance. In this article, we will introduce three typical tokenized social media, Steemit, Bihu, and Voice, in facets of their business models, token design, as well as insightful analysis about its strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT). Finally, we will discuss how tokenized social media revolutionizes the online communication ecology and builds the future community of diversity and inclusion. To recap, in Part 1 , we provide a brief introduction to three representative tokenized social media.

NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens), records on a blockchain that represents pieces of digital media, have become extremely popular this year. NFT marketplaces around the world play a vital role in the trading and liquidity of NFTs. This article introduces what to consider when choosing an NFT marketplace for listing and buying NFTs for your purpose. The currently existing NFT marketplaces worldwide often provide several different features and are built for distinct usage scenarios. Therefore, depending on the position in the NFT marketplace, you need to consider some things when choosing an NFT marketplace. NFT Marketplaces NFT marketplaces are online platforms built on the blockchain ( Ethereum in most cases) for NFTs to be displayed and traded. Sellers, like digital artists, can sell their NFTs on the NFT marketplaces. Buyers and collectors are able to browse and purchase the desired NFT primarily through bidding on the NFT marketplaces. To use an NFT marketplace, one must have a crypto wallet to complete transactions and store their currency. Figure 1: NFT Marketplaces According to data from DappRadar , there are over 30 active NFT marketplaces currently in the world. The number of NFT marketplaces for exchanging digital assets will be expected to rise with the popularity of NFTs. Also, the NFT marketplaces will become increasingly fragmented in the long run, and competition among them will become more intense. Depending on your position in the NFT trading, i.e. whether you are an artist or a digital artwork collector, here are the features you need to consider when choosing the best NFT marketplace that suits your needs. For Artists: Types of NFT Marketplaces The NFT marketplaces can be divided into two categories: the open marketplaces, where anyone can freely join as a creator, and the closed marketplaces, where only invited users, even companies, are allowed to register as creators. Unless you are a very famous digital artist, it is ideal to develop your career as an NFT artist through minting and selling on the open marketplaces and then preparing to be invited into a closed platform. Some NFT marketplaces (such as OpenSea ) are platforms that operate as open markets for all types of NFTs. As an open market NFT artist, you may face issues regarding exposure. In other words, compared with other closed communities, the exposure of NFT will decrease due to too many registered users. In the closed marketplaces, NFT artists can only mint and sell NFTs only if they are invited to enter the market. For example, as the most well-known closed marketplace, Foundation has been running on a mechanism called \u201c Community Upvote \u201d, providing artists with the opportunity to vote among themselves, where the top 50 artists with the highest number of votes can enter the community as creators. In addition, some NFT markets focus on narrower categories. The most famous is NBA Top Shot , which only sells basketball highlights as a virtual trading card. Figure 2: Community Upvote Mechanism on Foundation Fees for NFT Minting The process of the creation of NFTs is essential for artists. Similar to the process of creating coins through minting, adding NFT to the blockchain is called minting. Minting refers to the process of turning digital artwork into a part of the blockchain. Therefore, the NFTs of digital art is immutable. It is worth noting that after minting your NFT, it usually enters your wallet, which means you can cast on one marketplace and sell on another. Minting Techniques Using some minting techniques the marketplace might offer NFT creators more choices on the minting fees. For example, the minting technique, lazy minting, can postpone the gas fee for minting NFT until it is sold to its first buyer. In other words, the gas fee for minting is included in the same transaction that assigns the NFT to the buyer, so the NFT creator never has to pay the minting fee. Lazy minting has been adopted by some marketplaces, such as OpenSea and Rarible , which lowers the barriers to entry for artists and NFT creators. According to data from Rarible Analytics , before Rarible introduced lazy minting, the average gas fee of a single ERC-721 token minted on Rarible was 0.022 ETH, which was approximately equivalent to the US $82.26. The introduction of lazy minting makes it possible for artists to make NFTs at zero cost. Figure 3: Lazy Minting Feature Introduced by Rarible in October Blockchain The blockchain(s) that the NFT marketplaces are operating on also plays a crucial part in the NFT minting. Ethereum is the first decentralized blockchain technology to introduce NFT into the crypto world, on which most current NFT marketplaces are built. However, NFT transactions on Ethereum can be considered relatively expensive in terms of gas fees for smaller transactions. Several adjacent blockchains, such as Binance Smart Chain (BSC), Polygan (Matic), and Tron , compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), have been developed to optimize NFT transactions. Let\u2019s take Polygan as an example. Matic, which was later renamed Polygon, was developed to solve the scaling problem of Ethereum. Polygon\u2019s current scaling solution includes the Plasma chain, which allows users to transfer transactions from the main chain to the sub-chains to achieve fast and cheap transactions, and the PoS chain, which has its own proof-of-stake consensus mechanism to protect decentralization. In general, Polygon uses a combination of Plasma and PoS, on the premise of sharing security with Ethereum, to improve efficiency and ensure the security of transactions. In terms of transaction fees, Polygon\u2019s transaction fees are about $0.00004-$0.00012, which is far lower than the gas fee on Ethereum. As gas fees on Ethereum continue to rise, more NFT creators are turning to Polygan. In late August, the NFT social network Showtime announced that its users could mint NFTs on Polygon for free. This new feature of the platform became welcomed by many crypto artists to use Showtime. The gas fee-free NFT minting on Showtime using Polygan can be sold on OpenSea. Figure 4: The NFT Social Network Showtime Coming to Polygon Studios NFT Royalties and Token Standards NFT transactions, unlike traditional art transactions, allow artists to be paid through their sales and the royalties they may receive from subsequent sales. With blockchain technology, which allows secure traceability, secondary market sales are possible. According to data from NFT tracker NonFungible , more buyers and higher dollar volume are participating in the secondary market for NFTs. Figure 5: Buyers of NFT is higher in the secondary market than the primary market NFT royalties give the creator a certain percentage of the sale price each time the NFT is sold on the marketplace. The use of smart contracts will enable authors to obtain a share of the sales price automatically and immediately. Imagine you have created an NFT artwork on an NFT marketplace such as Rarible. A buyer purchased it for 8 ETH. Therefore, you obtained 8 ETH (Ethereum). Suppose you also enter a 10% royalty in the minting of this NFT, that is, whenever a sale occurs, you will get 10% of the revenue. Now, your buyers are auctioning your artwork at a higher price in the market. As your reputation improves, another buyer might buy it for 300 ETH. Since you have pre-coded 10% of the royalties into the NFT, you will receive 30 ETH from this sale. Figure 6: Setting your royalties on OpenSea The token standard also influences the creator\u2019s royalty in terms of cross-marketplace transactions. Not all NFT marketplaces utilize the same token standards as we have discussed in the last article. Commonly-used token standards include ERC-721, ERC-1155, and ERC-998. Understanding the token standards that underlie the NFTs will help users understand the different use scenarios of each type of NFT and the various blockchain protocols involved. For instance, Mintable only supports NFTs built with ERC-721 standards, while OpenSea supports ERC-721 and ERC-1155. The ERC-721 standard is now being revised to allow a more efficient method of payment of royalties. It aims to solve the problem of payment of copyright fees when NFT cross-marketplace transactions. The ERC-721 standard will support royalty fees transactions that do not depend on the marketplace on which the NFT is minted. For Collectors: Categories of NFTs The first thing to consider is the categories of NFT. Depending on what category of digital assets you plan to seek, there are NFT marketplaces with different mechanisms for you to search for and buy NFT. If you are a sports fan, the NBA Top Shot and Sorare are two of the most famous NFT marketplaces. The former is for selling digital trading cards of NBA players. The latter is a football game with collectable NFT cards. For digital artwork, which is the focus of many NFT marketplaces, Choosing the right marketplace often depends on the rarity and style of the artwork you are seeking. For example, the SuperRare marketplace considers the social aspects of the art collection, described as the \u201cInstagram meets Christie\u2019s\u201d. There are other sorts of NFT marketplace for virtual real estate, such as Decentraland , and for video games, such as Axie Infinity . Blockchain Choosing the appropriate blockchain that the NFT marketplace is built on is very important in many aspects, including scalability, transaction costs, and the degree of decentralization. Except for the Ethereum blockchain that most NFT marketplaces are built on, some other blockchains have been developed with strategies like energy-efficient blockchain transaction validation mechanisms. For example, Flow was developed by Dapper Labs , who are also the developers of CryptoKitties , to achieve a faster decentralized network, empowering the entire decentralized application ecosystem, especially games and digital collectables. NBA Top Shot is one of the NFT marketplaces built on Flow. Figure 7: The Flow Blockchain Payment Methods Another consideration is the payment methods supported by the NFT marketplace. That is, whether it is the case that users can use fiat currency to purchase NFTs in the marketplace or cryptocurrency is required for sales. Moreover, paying with credit cards and debit cards, and some other online payment methods, such as WeChat Pay in China, might be more convenient ways for new users, who might not be very familiar with cryptocurrency, to buy NFTs on the marketplace. Several NFT marketplaces such as SoRare have accepted multiple payment methods, including cryptocurrency, credit card, and debit card. However, many NFT marketplaces, such as Decentraland and SuperRare, still merely support cryptocurrency payment. Popular NFT Marketplaces OpenSea Figure 8: OpenSea As the world\u2019s largest NFT marketplace as well as one of the earliest established NFT marketplaces, OpenSea covers a wide range of NFT categories, including digital art, music, domain names, gaming assets, and cards. OpenSea is built on the Ethereum protocol and offers integrated support for the Klaytn and Polygon networks. The NFTs on the OpenSea include ERC721 and ERC1155 assets. OpenSea shares the gas fee more equally between creators and buyers, allowing people with tight budgets to mint NFTs. Features Fees: Lazy minting + 2.5% marketplace fee for each sale Blockchains: Ethereum, Polygon, Klaytn Token standards: ERC-721, ERC-1155 Supported payment methods: Credit card, Debit card, Cryptocurrency, Bank transfer Creator royalty on the secondary market: Configure up to 10% Rarible Figure 9: Rarible Rarible is another popular NFT marketplace globally, whose prominent category of NFTs available is digital art. What is spatial of Rarible compared to OpenSea is the \u201cRARI standard tokens\u201d, which allows the users to mint singles or multiples, add properties, set commission, and choose fixed-price sales and auctions. Rarible is built on Etheruem and uses token standards ERC-721, ERC-1155. Features Fees: Lazy minting + 2.5% marketplace fee for each sale Blockchains: Ethereum, Polygon Token standards: ERC-721, ERC-1155 Supported payment methods: Cryptocurrency Creator royalty on the secondary market: Open-ended Nifty Gateway Figure 10: Nifty Gateway Nifty Gateway is an NFT auction house and marketplace featuring major artists and creators supported by the Gemini cryptocurrency exchange. Nifty Gateway has sold NFTs by Beeple, Grimes, LOGIK, and other famous NFT artists. Nifty Gateway is designed to allow everyone to collect NFT. However, for minting on this marketplace, you must apply. At Nifty Gateway, fiat currency is the most important means of payment. Therefore, this market is not suitable for people who is extremely passionate about Ethereum/DeFi. Features Fees: 20% marketplace fee for each sale Blockchains: Ethereum Token standards: ERC-721 Supported payment methods: Credit card primarily, with prepaid ETH for some transactions Creator royalty on the secondary market: 5% Foundation Figure 11: Foundation Foundation is an application that facilitates real-time auctions of NFTs. Foundation is exclusive, which means one must be invited by the existing creator of Foundation instead of submitting an application. As we introduced before, Foundation runs on the mechanism of \u201cCommunity Upvote\u201d. The advantage of participating in Foundation lies in its high level. If you are a Foundation artist, collectors will know that you are at this level where your works are more likely to get high value. Features Fees: Gas fees + 15% marketplace fee for each sale Blockchains: Ethereum Token standards: ERC-721 Supported payment methods: Cryptocurrency Creator royalty on the secondary market: 10% on Foundation or OpenSea only Conclusion With the upsurge of NFTs, the number and categories of NFT marketplaces are expected to increase in the long run. Many of the current marketplaces are built for certain targeted users with specific purpose such as buying NFT collectives of highlight reels, while some serve a larger group of NFT creators and collectors. Therefore, this article helps you to choose the best NFT marketplace that suits your needs, depending on what your position is in this boom of NFT. We provide a flowchart to guide your decision in figure 10 and figure 11.

NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens), records on a blockchain that represents pieces of digital media, have become extremely popular this year. NFT marketplaces around the world play a vital role in the trading and liquidity of NFTs. This article introduces what to consider when choosing an NFT marketplace for listing and buying NFTs for your purpose. The currently existing NFT marketplaces worldwide often provide several different features and are built for distinct usage scenarios.

Sellers, like digital artists, can sell their NFTs on the NFT marketplaces. Buyers and collectors are able to browse and purchase the desired NFT primarily through bidding on the NFT marketplaces. To use an NFT marketplace, one must have a crypto wallet to complete transactions and store their currency. Figure 1: NFT Marketplaces According to data from DappRadar , there are over 30 active NFT marketplaces currently in the world. The number of NFT marketplaces for exchanging digital assets will be expected to rise with the popularity of NFTs. Also, the NFT marketplaces will become increasingly fragmented in the long run, and competition among them will become more intense. Depending on your position in the NFT trading, i.e. whether you are an artist or a digital artwork collector, here are the features you need to consider when choosing the best NFT marketplace that suits your needs.","title":"NFT Marketplaces"},{"location":"articles/Research/NFTMarketplace%3AHowtoChoosetheRightNFTMarketplaceforArtistsandCollectors/#for-artists","text":"","title":"For Artists:"},{"location":"articles/Research/NFTMarketplace%3AHowtoChoosetheRightNFTMarketplaceforArtistsandCollectors/#types-of-nft-marketplaces","text":"The NFT marketplaces can be divided into two categories: the open marketplaces, where anyone can freely join as a creator, and the closed marketplaces, where only invited users, even companies, are allowed to register as creators. Unless you are a very famous digital artist, it is ideal to develop your career as an NFT artist through minting and selling on the open marketplaces and then preparing to be invited into a closed platform. Some NFT marketplaces (such as OpenSea ) are platforms that operate as open markets for all types of NFTs. As an open market NFT artist, you may face issues regarding exposure. In other words, compared with other closed communities, the exposure of NFT will decrease due to too many registered users. In the closed marketplaces, NFT artists can only mint and sell NFTs only if they are invited to enter the market. For example, as the most well-known closed marketplace, Foundation has been running on a mechanism called \u201c Community Upvote \u201d, providing artists with the opportunity to vote among themselves, where the top 50 artists with the highest number of votes can enter the community as creators. In addition, some NFT markets focus on narrower categories. The most famous is NBA Top Shot , which only sells basketball highlights as a virtual trading card.

Similar to the process of creating coins through minting, adding NFT to the blockchain is called minting. Minting refers to the process of turning digital artwork into a part of the blockchain. Therefore, the NFTs of digital art is immutable. It is worth noting that after minting your NFT, it usually enters your wallet, which means you can cast on one marketplace and sell on another.","title":"Fees for NFT Minting"},{"location":"articles/Research/NFTMarketplace%3AHowtoChoosetheRightNFTMarketplaceforArtistsandCollectors/#minting-techniques","text":"Using some minting techniques the marketplace might offer NFT creators more choices on the minting fees. For example, the minting technique, lazy minting, can postpone the gas fee for minting NFT until it is sold to its first buyer. In other words, the gas fee for minting is included in the same transaction that assigns the NFT to the buyer, so the NFT creator never has to pay the minting fee. Lazy minting has been adopted by some marketplaces, such as OpenSea and Rarible , which lowers the barriers to entry for artists and NFT creators. According to data from Rarible Analytics , before Rarible introduced lazy minting, the average gas fee of a single ERC-721 token minted on Rarible was 0.022 ETH, which was approximately equivalent to the US $82.26. The introduction of lazy minting makes it possible for artists to make NFTs at zero cost. Figure 3: Lazy Minting Feature Introduced by Rarible in October","title":"Minting Techniques"},{"location":"articles/Research/NFTMarketplace%3AHowtoChoosetheRightNFTMarketplaceforArtistsandCollectors/#blockchain","text":"The blockchain(s) that the NFT marketplaces are operating on also plays a crucial part in the NFT minting. Ethereum is the first decentralized blockchain technology to introduce NFT into the crypto world, on which most current NFT marketplaces are built. However, NFT transactions on Ethereum can be considered relatively expensive in terms of gas fees for smaller transactions. Several adjacent blockchains, such as Binance Smart Chain (BSC), Polygan (Matic), and Tron , compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), have been developed to optimize NFT transactions. Let\u2019s take Polygan as an example. Matic, which was later renamed Polygon, was developed to solve the scaling problem of Ethereum. Polygon\u2019s current scaling solution includes the Plasma chain, which allows users to transfer transactions from the main chain to the sub-chains to achieve fast and cheap transactions, and the PoS chain, which has its own proof-of-stake consensus mechanism to protect decentralization. In general, Polygon uses a combination of Plasma and PoS, on the premise of sharing security with Ethereum, to improve efficiency and ensure the security of transactions. In terms of transaction fees, Polygon\u2019s transaction fees are about $0.00004-$0.00012, which is far lower than the gas fee on Ethereum. As gas fees on Ethereum continue to rise, more NFT creators are turning to Polygan. In late August, the NFT social network Showtime announced that its users could mint NFTs on Polygon for free. This new feature of the platform became welcomed by many crypto artists to use Showtime. The gas fee-free NFT minting on Showtime using Polygan can be sold on OpenSea. Figure 4: The NFT Social Network Showtime Coming to Polygon Studios","title":"Blockchain"},{"location":"articles/Research/NFTMarketplace%3AHowtoChoosetheRightNFTMarketplaceforArtistsandCollectors/#nft-royalties-and-token-standards","text":"NFT transactions, unlike traditional art transactions, allow artists to be paid through their sales and the royalties they may receive from subsequent sales. With blockchain technology, which allows secure traceability, secondary market sales are possible. According to data from NFT tracker NonFungible , more buyers and higher dollar volume are participating in the secondary market for NFTs. Figure 5: Buyers of NFT is higher in the secondary market than the primary market NFT royalties give the creator a certain percentage of the sale price each time the NFT is sold on the marketplace. The use of smart contracts will enable authors to obtain a share of the sales price automatically and immediately. Imagine you have created an NFT artwork on an NFT marketplace such as Rarible. A buyer purchased it for 8 ETH. Therefore, you obtained 8 ETH (Ethereum). Suppose you also enter a 10% royalty in the minting of this NFT, that is, whenever a sale occurs, you will get 10% of the revenue. Now, your buyers are auctioning your artwork at a higher price in the market. As your reputation improves, another buyer might buy it for 300 ETH. Since you have pre-coded 10% of the royalties into the NFT, you will receive 30 ETH from this sale. Figure 6: Setting your royalties on OpenSea The token standard also influences the creator\u2019s royalty in terms of cross-marketplace transactions. Not all NFT marketplaces utilize the same token standards as we have discussed in the last article. Commonly-used token standards include ERC-721, ERC-1155, and ERC-998. Understanding the token standards that underlie the NFTs will help users understand the different use scenarios of each type of NFT and the various blockchain protocols involved. For instance, Mintable only supports NFTs built with ERC-721 standards, while OpenSea supports ERC-721 and ERC-1155. The ERC-721 standard is now being revised to allow a more efficient method of payment of royalties. It aims to solve the problem of payment of copyright fees when NFT cross-marketplace transactions. The ERC-721 standard will support royalty fees transactions that do not depend on the marketplace on which the NFT is minted.","title":"NFT Royalties and Token Standards"},{"location":"articles/Research/NFTMarketplace%3AHowtoChoosetheRightNFTMarketplaceforArtistsandCollectors/#for-collectors","text":"","title":"For Collectors:"},{"location":"articles/Research/NFTMarketplace%3AHowtoChoosetheRightNFTMarketplaceforArtistsandCollectors/#categories-of-nfts","text":"The first thing to consider is the categories of NFT.

The latter is a football game with collectable NFT cards. For digital artwork, which is the focus of many NFT marketplaces, Choosing the right marketplace often depends on the rarity and style of the artwork you are seeking. For example, the SuperRare marketplace considers the social aspects of the art collection, described as the \u201cInstagram meets Christie\u2019s\u201d.

As Dean Sam, a writer in Los Angeles Times, defined, non-fungible token (NFT) is a unit of data stored on the Blockchain that certifies a digital asset to be unique. NFTs can be used to represent digital files, such as photos, videos, audio, and so on. Moreover, the Blockchain will record the ownership and specific information about this asset. NFT is different from traditional physical goods, and they need new marketplaces. Many market platforms for trading NFT assets have been born on the Blockchain. With the rising price of NFT assets, more and more players have entered this field. On March 11th this year, an NFT artwork named \u201cEverydays \u2014 The First 5000 Days\u201d was sold for an extremely high price of $69 million on Christie\u2019s auction website, which shocked everyone [1] . In addition, a lot of well-known companies are targeting the NFT market. In July, Coca-Cola, the world-famous beverage company, announced that it began selling its NFT souvenirs collection. Budweiser, another beverage giant, also began to buy NFT products in July. In the same month, Rolling Stone magazine has also joined the NFT market [2] . Such examples have appeared a lot recently. On the whole, the market is in a stage of rapid development. The whole NFT market achieved more than $2 billion in transactions in the first quarter of 2021 \u2014 which is 2000 percent higher than the fourth quarter of 2020 [3] . When seeing this shocking data, you may have doubts: Why can such virtual items sell at these extremely high prices? What are the prevailing technical standards? What are the mechanisms of the NFT auction? What does the NFT marketplace bring us? We prepared two NFT Marketplace articles for you. In this first article, I\u2019ll introduce the questions above to you. And in the second article, we will instruct you on choosing the most suitable NFT marketplace for you. Figure 1: \u201cEverydays \u2014 The First 5000 Days\u201d is a collage of all the images that the artist known as Beeple has been posting online each day since 2007. Why can NFTs sell at such a high price? For all goods, scarcity is a critical price determinant. At present, most of the goods in the NFT auction market are limited edition works of art, which have set a foundation for their price. In addition, NFT has a feature that traditional works of art cannot have, that is \u2014 \u2014 the display function in the information age. Just as the co-founder of CryptoPunks, John Watkinson, said, \u201cthere was a showing-off factor, flashing what you have to other people in a virtual way was the only way to do it.\u201d [1] As the boss of the blockchain market, he is very familiar with the leading customer groups in the NFT market. \u201cThere are some wealthy individuals in Silicon Valley collecting these now. If you own a rare one of these, it\u2019s meaningful,\u201d he said. Just imagine, if you are a person who likes collecting artworks, you have a lot of great art at home. However, most of the time you can only enjoy them at home by yourself, or sometimes invite friends to visit at home. But now, you can buy NFT artworks, display them on all your social media platforms, and all Internet users can see that you own them on your home page. Are these feelings and experiences very attractive? In addition, NFT also has the characteristics of Blockchain. Others can see your ownership of these NFTs on the Blockchain. The above paragraphs explain why virtual collections can have such high value. Figure 2: An NFT product from Coca Cola \u2014 bubble jacket. The Technical Standards of NFT After discussing the formation of the NFT value, we should also understand the operation mechanism behind it. Therefore, the following content will be more in-depth and introduce the technical standards and characteristics. As a new blockchain product, NFT has many technical standards. Different technical standards correspond to various methods of generating NFT on Blockchain. Commonly used token standards include ERC-721, ERC-1155 and ERC-998 [4] . Among them, ERC-721 is the most basic and popular one, ERC-1155 is the mainstream standard in the game industry, and ERC-998 can contain multiple tokens. The NFT marketplace developers may choose different standards. For example, OpenSea, one of the most popular NFT marketplace, only supports NFTs built with ERC-721 and ERC-1155 standards. The most commonly used one among all is ERC-721. The first project that used ERC-721 is CryptoKitties, a collectible game that caused congestion on the Ethereum network in 2017 [5] . And the standard ERC-721 was created and released by the project\u2019s CTO, Dieter Shirley [6] . Since then, ERC-721 has entered people\u2019s vision. And it has become the most widely used NFT standard. The second popular standard is ERC-1155. It is originated from game development. Enjin\u2019s CTO, Witek Radomski, created ERC-1155 standard [7] . This standard was created for the reason that the game developers need to send props to multiple accounts in the game. However, it is costly to call a smart contract every time for each account. Thus, the ERC-1155 standard was created. Since it has both the characteristics of NFT and FT (Fungible Token), ERC-1155 is a so-called semi-fungible token. The main difference with NFT is that one token no longer refers to a specific item but a class of items. In other words, there is no difference between objects with the same token ID. Another standard, ERC-998, is not as common as the above two standards, which establishes composable non-homogeneous tokens (CNFT) , whose structural design allows any NFT to be bundled with other NFTs or FTs [8] . ERC-998 tokens can contain multiple ERC-721 and ERC-20 tokens. When transferring CNFT, it means moving the entire hierarchical structure and relationships of the CNFT. For example, in CryptoKitties, a cat can have non-fungible tokens, like a chain around the neck. ERC-998 can pack everything in one for transfer. Figure 3: How Smart Contracts Works What does the NFT Marketplace Bring Us? When people create NFTs, they will naturally consider trading NFTs. Followed by many NFT trading markets, so what are their characteristics? The idea of digital trading assets in the NFT marketplace provides some unique advantages for creators and people like collectors and art enthusiasts. Taking digital artwork as an example, NFT has the potential to solve some of the shortcomings in the traditional art market. First, in the conventional art market, the fluidity of artwork is very poor. That is, a piece of artwork usually only changes its ownership a few times. However, trading artwork will become extremely easy via NFT marketplaces. Second, it is almost impossible for artists to get paid from the second sale of their artwork in the traditional art market. In contrast, many NFT marketplaces support artists to choose the percentage of royalties they want from secondary sales. Figure 4: Total number of sales involving a non-fungible token (NFT) in the art sector worldwide over the previous 30 days from April 12 to October 15, 2021, by type Therefore, NFT marketplaces ensure users can browse and trade NFTs flexibly and solve the problems of creators\u2019 income in the traditional market. Although all NFT marketplaces operate similarly, a hub dedicated to NFT transactions built on the Blockchain, different NFT marketplaces provide various functions. Figure 5: NFT Marketplace System The two mechanisms of NFT auction Among all the NFT trading modes in the marketplace, the auction is the most popular and mainstream trading form. Many high-priced NFTs in the news were sold by auctions. When talking about NFT auctions on the network platform, it is unfamiliar to many people. In the public\u2019s impression, the traditional auction is generally in a banquet hall, and the host stands on the stage shouting the current price. However, the auction of NFT is on the network trading platform. And there are two main auction mechanisms: centralization and decentralization. Figure6 Popular NFT Marketplaces A decentralized NFT auction platform connects buyers to sellers via a smart contract. The smart contract handles the logic and transferring information between the bid of the NFT. This entire exchange happens fully on-chain. Many famous auction platforms are using this mechanism, including OpenSea , Nifty Gateway , etc. In the following, I will explain the advantages of the decentralized auction over the centralized auction. After that, you can also find the advantages of the decentralized auction. These two auction methods have their own advantages. The advantages of the decentralized auction: 1. Every bid is public and permanently recorded, which makes bids more secure and transparent. 2. It does not need a third-party agent; smart contracts will run the auction. A centralized NFT auction platform has just emerged in recent months. This auction mechanism is off-chain bidding, which is similar to the traditional goods auction platform. It brings some advantages of centralization into the NFT auction platform. Artists and NFT sellers can still sell and buy NFT artworks on the platform, and the auction platform will send the works to the buyer\u2019s wallet after the transaction. The advantages of the centralized auction: 1. Bidders can use fiat currency like US dollars. It is more convenient than buying cryptocurrency before an auction. Bidders don\u2019t need to observe the price change of ETH, one of the most mainstream cryptocurrencies in the world, when bidding. 2. There is no need to pay gas fees when bidding, which is cheaper. 3. It provides a varied group of potential customers and helps the auction agent ensure the legitimacy of auction guests. 4. Customers can go back after taking the goods, although they have to pay a deposit. According to the advantages of both decentralized and centralized auction provided above, we want to deliver the following suggestions to help you choose from the two auction mechanisms. First, if you are a new player in the NFT market and want to have your first try, the centralized auction is suitable for you. Because you don\u2019t need to pay expensive gas fees when bidding. And you don\u2019t need to create a crypto wallet, which means you can use fiat currency conveniently. Then, if you are an experienced NFT buyer or blockchain enthusiast, we recommend that you directly choose the decentralized auction. Because decentralized auction markets usually have more collectibles to choose from. In addition, decentralized auctions are more stable and faster. In the end, we wish you to have a great buying experience, whether you\u2019re a beginner or a veteran gamer. In the next article in this series, we will bring you a guideline and instructions for the selection of the NFT marketplace.

As Dean Sam, a writer in Los Angeles Times, defined, non-fungible token (NFT) is a unit of data stored on the Blockchain that certifies a digital asset to be unique. NFTs can be used to represent digital files, such as photos, videos, audio, and so on. Moreover, the Blockchain will record the ownership and specific information about this asset. NFT is different from traditional physical goods, and they need new marketplaces. Many market platforms for trading NFT assets have been born on the Blockchain. With the rising price of NFT assets, more and more players have entered this field. On March 11th this year, an NFT artwork named \u201cEverydays \u2014 The First 5000 Days\u201d was sold for an extremely high price of $69 million on Christie\u2019s auction website, which shocked everyone [1] . In addition, a lot of well-known companies are targeting the NFT market. In July, Coca-Cola, the world-famous beverage company, announced that it began selling its NFT souvenirs collection. Budweiser, another beverage giant, also began to buy NFT products in July. In the same month, Rolling Stone magazine has also joined the NFT market [2] . Such examples have appeared a lot recently. On the whole, the market is in a stage of rapid development. The whole NFT market achieved more than $2 billion in transactions in the first quarter of 2021 \u2014 which is 2000 percent higher than the fourth quarter of 2020 [3] . When seeing this shocking data, you may have doubts: Why can such virtual items sell at these extremely high prices? What are the prevailing technical standards? What are the mechanisms of the NFT auction? What does the NFT marketplace bring us? We prepared two NFT Marketplace articles for you. In this first article, I\u2019ll introduce the questions above to you. And in the second article, we will instruct you on choosing the most suitable NFT marketplace for you. Figure 1: \u201cEverydays \u2014 The First 5000 Days\u201d is a collage of all the images that the artist known as Beeple has been posting online each day since 2007.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"articles/Research/NFTMarketplace%3AIntroductiontoNFTandNFTmarketplace%E2%80%99smechanism/#why-can-nfts-sell-at-such-a-high-price","text":"For all goods, scarcity is a critical price determinant. At present, most of the goods in the NFT auction market are limited edition works of art, which have set a foundation for their price. In addition, NFT has a feature that traditional works of art cannot have, that is \u2014 \u2014 the display function in the information age. Just as the co-founder of CryptoPunks, John Watkinson, said, \u201cthere was a showing-off factor, flashing what you have to other people in a virtual way was the only way to do it.\u201d [1] As the boss of the blockchain market, he is very familiar with the leading customer groups in the NFT market. \u201cThere are some wealthy individuals in Silicon Valley collecting these now. If you own a rare one of these, it\u2019s meaningful,\u201d he said. Just imagine, if you are a person who likes collecting artworks, you have a lot of great art at home. However, most of the time you can only enjoy them at home by yourself, or sometimes invite friends to visit at home. But now, you can buy NFT artworks, display them on all your social media platforms, and all Internet users can see that you own them on your home page. Are these feelings and experiences very attractive? In addition, NFT also has the characteristics of Blockchain. Others can see your ownership of these NFTs on the Blockchain. The above paragraphs explain why virtual collections can have such high value.

Therefore, the following content will be more in-depth and introduce the technical standards and characteristics. As a new blockchain product, NFT has many technical standards. Different technical standards correspond to various methods of generating NFT on Blockchain. Commonly used token standards include ERC-721, ERC-1155 and ERC-998 [4] . Among them, ERC-721 is the most basic and popular one, ERC-1155 is the mainstream standard in the game industry, and ERC-998 can contain multiple tokens. The NFT marketplace developers may choose different standards. For example, OpenSea, one of the most popular NFT marketplace, only supports NFTs built with ERC-721 and ERC-1155 standards. The most commonly used one among all is ERC-721. The first project that used ERC-721 is CryptoKitties, a collectible game that caused congestion on the Ethereum network in 2017 [5] . And the standard ERC-721 was created and released by the project\u2019s CTO, Dieter Shirley [6] . Since then, ERC-721 has entered people\u2019s vision. And it has become the most widely used NFT standard. The second popular standard is ERC-1155. It is originated from game development. Enjin\u2019s CTO, Witek Radomski, created ERC-1155 standard [7] . This standard was created for the reason that the game developers need to send props to multiple accounts in the game. However, it is costly to call a smart contract every time for each account. Thus, the ERC-1155 standard was created. Since it has both the characteristics of NFT and FT (Fungible Token), ERC-1155 is a so-called semi-fungible token. The main difference with NFT is that one token no longer refers to a specific item but a class of items. In other words, there is no difference between objects with the same token ID. Another standard, ERC-998, is not as common as the above two standards, which establishes composable non-homogeneous tokens (CNFT) , whose structural design allows any NFT to be bundled with other NFTs or FTs [8] . ERC-998 tokens can contain multiple ERC-721 and ERC-20 tokens. When transferring CNFT, it means moving the entire hierarchical structure and relationships of the CNFT. For example, in CryptoKitties, a cat can have non-fungible tokens, like a chain around the neck. ERC-998 can pack everything in one for transfer. Figure 3: How Smart Contracts Works","title":"The Technical Standards of NFT"},{"location":"articles/Research/NFTMarketplace%3AIntroductiontoNFTandNFTmarketplace%E2%80%99smechanism/#what-does-the-nft-marketplace-bring-us","text":"When people create NFTs, they will naturally consider trading NFTs. Followed by many NFT trading markets, so what are their characteristics? The idea of digital trading assets in the NFT marketplace provides some unique advantages for creators and people like collectors and art enthusiasts. Taking digital artwork as an example, NFT has the potential to solve some of the shortcomings in the traditional art market. First, in the conventional art market, the fluidity of artwork is very poor. That is, a piece of artwork usually only changes its ownership a few times. However, trading artwork will become extremely easy via NFT marketplaces. Second, it is almost impossible for artists to get paid from the second sale of their artwork in the traditional art market. In contrast, many NFT marketplaces support artists to choose the percentage of royalties they want from secondary sales. Figure 4: Total number of sales involving a non-fungible token (NFT) in the art sector worldwide over the previous 30 days from April 12 to October 15, 2021, by type Therefore, NFT marketplaces ensure users can browse and trade NFTs flexibly and solve the problems of creators\u2019 income in the traditional market. Although all NFT marketplaces operate similarly, a hub dedicated to NFT transactions built on the Blockchain, different NFT marketplaces provide various functions. Figure 5: NFT Marketplace System","title":"What does the NFT Marketplace Bring Us?"},{"location":"articles/Research/NFTMarketplace%3AIntroductiontoNFTandNFTmarketplace%E2%80%99smechanism/#the-two-mechanisms-of-nft-auction","text":"Among all the NFT trading modes in the marketplace, the auction is the most popular and mainstream trading form. Many high-priced NFTs in the news were sold by auctions. When talking about NFT auctions on the network platform, it is unfamiliar to many people. In the public\u2019s impression, the traditional auction is generally in a banquet hall, and the host stands on the stage shouting the current price. However, the auction of NFT is on the network trading platform. And there are two main auction mechanisms: centralization and decentralization. Figure6 Popular NFT Marketplaces A decentralized NFT auction platform connects buyers to sellers via a smart contract. The smart contract handles the logic and transferring information between the bid of the NFT. This entire exchange happens fully on-chain. Many famous auction platforms are using this mechanism, including OpenSea , Nifty Gateway , etc. In the following, I will explain the advantages of the decentralized auction over the centralized auction. After that, you can also find the advantages of the decentralized auction. These two auction methods have their own advantages. The advantages of the decentralized auction: 1. Every bid is public and permanently recorded, which makes bids more secure and transparent. 2. It does not need a third-party agent; smart contracts will run the auction. A centralized NFT auction platform has just emerged in recent months. This auction mechanism is off-chain bidding, which is similar to the traditional goods auction platform. It brings some advantages of centralization into the NFT auction platform. Artists and NFT sellers can still sell and buy NFT artworks on the platform, and the auction platform will send the works to the buyer\u2019s wallet after the transaction. The advantages of the centralized auction: 1. Bidders can use fiat currency like US dollars. It is more convenient than buying cryptocurrency before an auction. Bidders don\u2019t need to observe the price change of ETH, one of the most mainstream cryptocurrencies in the world, when bidding. 2. There is no need to pay gas fees when bidding, which is cheaper. 3. It provides a varied group of potential customers and helps the auction agent ensure the legitimacy of auction guests. 4. Customers can go back after taking the goods, although they have to pay a deposit. According to the advantages of both decentralized and centralized auction provided above, we want to deliver the following suggestions to help you choose from the two auction mechanisms. First, if you are a new player in the NFT market and want to have your first try, the centralized auction is suitable for you. Because you don\u2019t need to pay expensive gas fees when bidding. And you don\u2019t need to create a crypto wallet, which means you can use fiat currency conveniently. Then, if you are an experienced NFT buyer or blockchain enthusiast, we recommend that you directly choose the decentralized auction. Because decentralized auction markets usually have more collectibles to choose from. In addition, decentralized auctions are more stable and faster. In the end, we wish you to have a great buying experience, whether you\u2019re a beginner or a veteran gamer. In the next article in this series, we will bring you a guideline and instructions for the selection of the NFT marketplace.

Prof. Campbell Harvey at Fuqua School of Business, Duke University [2] gave a guest lecture entitled \u201cDeFi and the Future of Finance\u201d as a distinguished guest speaker for this course. Xinyu Tian, majoring in Data Science, and Tianyu Wu, majoring in Applied Mathematics and Computational Sciences/Math from the class of 2023 were the Teaching Assistants for this course. Instructor highlights: Zhiyi Chen provides a distinct view of blockchain for social good. The current major application of blockchain is for the private sector. However, the application to the public sector is still in its infancy. Zhiyi brought our attention to the important global issues of environmental sustainability, government management, and ethical considerations, which are path-breaking and thought-provoking. Figure 1: Overview of Flowchart (created by Whimsical) Opening Remarks Blockchain technology, first proposed by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008, is a \u201cdistributed append-only time-stamped data structure\u201d (Casino, Dasaklis, and Patsakis 2019, 56) with a distributed peer-to-peer network to record transaction history for non-trusting members (Nakamoto 2008) . Blockchain technology is the key to decentralized finance (Harvey, Ramachandran, and Santoro 2021, 13) , which enables cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ether, and applications such as Smart Contracts. The application of blockchain technology appears in various fields, as shown in Figure 2, and offers efficient and transparent solutions to emerging problems in those fields. Various scholars and researchers analyze its limitations, such as governance and regulation risks, and its strengths, such as privacy and safety. Fulfilling gaps between theory and application, overcoming application limitations, and exploring new application directions are important goals of applying blockchain technology, motivating people to study further. Figure 2: Mind Map of Different Blockchain Technology Applications (Casino, Dasaklis, and Patsakis 2019, 62 ) This debate documentary will focus on three perspectives of the blockchain technology application, which are the relationship between blockchain technology and achieving environmental sustainability, the application of blockchain technology in government management, and ethical considerations in the application process. Starting with the first perspective, this debate explores how the blockchain technology application can contribute to environmental sustainability by offering a transparent and trusted monitoring system and finding low-energy solutions. Then this debate points out the problems of energy consumption by mining and producing environmental pollution. Continuing with applying blockchain technology in government management, this debate illustrates its strength of avoiding corruption and improving efficiency and its limitations of unreliable data inputs and regulatory uncertainty. Finally, this debate discusses the ethical considerations in the blockchain technology application concerning equality as well as whether blockchain technology is beneficial to human beings. Thesis Perspective 1: Achieving environmental sustainability: Can the blockchain technology application contribute to environmental sustainability? Pro: Taemin Lee In my opinion, the application of blockchain technology plays an important role in achieving environmental sustainability by establishing a transparent and trusted monitoring system to record the transaction history of cash flow in environmental governance. Due to the decentralized nature of blockchain technology, all transactions could be transparently observed in this monitoring system \u201cby either having a personal node or by using blockchain explorers\u201d (Conway n.d.) . This monitoring system is trusted, as new \u201cblocks\u201d (referring to new transaction history here) are added to the end of the blockchain chronologically and it will be difficult to alter previous transaction history without a majority consensus (Conway n.d.) . Consequently, for both governmental organizations and non-governmental organizations, this transparent and trusted system, which is free of fraud and tampering, can ensure the cash and donations get to beneficiaries who need the money most and solve environmental problems, such as managing climate change, with clean hands. The United Nations has just illustrated the successful pilot program of this monitoring system in Pakistan and identified applying blockchain technology as a sustainable solution to the environmental crisis ( Sustainability Solution or Climate Calamity 2021) . So, I think the application of blockchain technology will contribute to environmental sustainability. Con: Seulgi Kang Although blockchain technology can contribute to environmental sustainability by establishing a monitoring system to record transaction history, the blockchain-backed cryptocurrency, such as Bitcoin and Ether, consumes a staggering amount of energy for mining. By the nature of the proof-of-work system, the mining process is like a computational race, which can only be achieved by solving complex mathematical problems with high-powered computers (Frankenfield n.d.) . BBC has reported that Bitcoin uses around 121.36 Terawatt-hours of electricity per year, consuming more energy than Argentina (Criddle 2021) . According to Digiconomist, the annualized total Ethereum footprint is comparable to the power consumption of Chile and the carbon footprint of Trinidad and Tobago (Ethereum Energy Consumption Index n.d.) . Also, because the major portion of the global energy is powered by fossil-fueled power plants, this staggering energy consumption will be responsible for greenhouse gas emissions and global climate change, which is not conducive for environmental sustainability. Perspective 2: Government Management: Should we apply blockchain technology to government management? Pro: Mina Sharon Myoi From my perspective, I think that we should apply blockchain technology to government management for fighting against corruption. Blockchain technology guarantees the authenticity of stored information by providing the traceable transaction history and eliminating falsification due to the tamper-resistant nature (as Taemin discussed previously, it will be difficult to alter previous information without a majority consensus). According to Santiso (2018) , the blockchain technology applied in government management can fight against corruption by registering assets and tracking transactions such as cash transfers and aid funds. Also, in China, the Shenzhen government has issued the blockchain electronic invoice to fight against corruption and ensure taxation for its accountability and safety ( China\u2019s first blockchain electronic invoice 2018) . In contrast with only monitoring environmental governance, applying blockchain technology in the government management means it participates in the governance by becoming certifications of taxes and assets. Consequently, this technology will be a powerful tool for government management to establish a clean-fingered government. Con: Yeji Hwang Although the application of blockchain technology in government management may fight against corruption with transparency and authenticity, applying it cannot eliminate corruption and may cause the problem of unreliable first data entries. As Pisa and Juden (2017) argued, \u201cblockchain is a \u2018garbage-in-garbage-out\u2019 system\u201d and the reliability of information stored on blockchains depends entirely on first data entries. For most socio-economic data, they are input by human beings rather than robots, and there is a high possibility that the corrupted person inputs the falsified data into blocks, which still causes corruption. Without supportive institutions and supervisory policies, the goal of dismantling corruption cannot be achieved. Therefore, I don\u2019t think disrupting corruption is a persuasive reason to apply blockchain technology in government management. Perspective 3: Ethical Considerations: Are there any ethical considerations when applying blockchain technology? Pro: Taehyung Kim As far as I am concerned, applying blockchain technology will contribute to equality by solving the problem of limited access and ensuring an equal share of economic goods. As the key to decentralized finance, blockchain technology solves the problem of limited access by allowing any user, regardless of wealth or geographic location, access to the financial infrastructure (Harvey, Ramachandran, and Santoro 2021, 35) . By applying blockchain technology, people may have an equal chance to get access to financial services \u201cwith the most competitive pricing and most favorable terms\u201d as large institutions (Harvey, Ramachandran, and Santoro 2021, 35) . And blockchain technology can lower the hurdle for SMEs and startups to get loans and financial support from banks (SciEcon 2021) . Also, by using the distributed blockchain-backed ownership system, people can own the share of economic goods from the production side and narrow the unequal gap (Berggruen 2018) . Consequently, the application of blockchain technology contributes to equality. Con: Zhiyi Chen Even if applying blockchain technology can offer more equal opportunities in various fields, the application of blockchain technology widens the inequalities in areas of education, digitality, and language. I am a junior student in the university who has learned the topic of blockchain technology in my courses and explored this topic for assignments, but I still have plenty of inquiries about this technology and cannot apply it in reality. In the world, many people receive less education than me and live in developing countries, never hearing about blockchain technology before. According to the United Nations (2020) , there are \u201cabout 260 million children still out of school in 2018\u201d. The different educational level prevents the less educated people from applying this technology, which increases inequality in blockchain applications. Also, due to the socio-economic differences, many people in the world cannot have access to modern technology, such as phones and computers, which refers to the digital divide. The inability of getting access to computers will prevent people from applying blockchain technology, which widens the unequal gap in its application. In addition, the developers of blockchain technology use English as their primary language, which blocks users speaking a minority language from using this technology and widens the gap of inequality. Overall, the education, digital, and language gap select a certain group of people to apply blockchain technology, which is not conducive to equality. Antithesis Perspective 1: Achieving environmental sustainability: Can the blockchain technology application contribute to environmental sustainability? Pro: Seulgi Kang Although the mining process consumes a staggering amount of energy, the shift to a less energy-intensive standard of verifying transactions can be an environmentally friendly way to achieve environmental sustainability when applying blockchain technology. For example, the proof-of-stake system requires users to show their ownership of the cryptocurrency instead of mining, which theoretically lowers the energy consumption for each transaction (Li 2021) . Particularly, proof-of-stake blockchains such as EOS and Cardano can \u201callow transactions to be processed with the same energy requirements as an ordinary computer network\u201d (Reiff n.d.) . According to the Ethereum Foundation, switching to this proof-of-stake system will cut the energy cost of each transaction by 99.95 percent ( Sustainability Solution or Climate Calamity 2021) . Consequently, using an environmentally-friendly proofing method for blockchain technology can contribute to environmental sustainability. Con: Taemin Lee I agree that the proof-of-stake system can be beneficial to environmental sustainability by reducing energy consumption, but this proofing method is used in limited digital platforms and Bitcoin still takes the major proportion of global cryptocurrencies, as shown in Figure 3. Under this circumstance, the environmental problems that Bitcoin mining brings, such as generating electronic wastes and causing thermal water pollution, will exert a larger impact on environmental sustainability than the influence of energy reduction by using the proof-of-stake system. These environmental problems pose great threats to environmental sustainability. The blockchain sector (especially Bitcoin) is considered as one of the biggest contributors to electronic waste, as old miners are discarded after becoming obsolete (Stevens 2020) . A single Bitcoin transaction produces \u201cover double the electronic waste produced by 10,000 VISA transactions\u201d (Stevens 2020) . Also, Bitcoin mining needs large amounts of water as coolants. The heated water will be directly released to lakes or rivers nearby, causing thermal water pollution, which decreases the oxygen supply and affects the ecosystem. A recent example is that the Greenidge Bitcoin company warms the glacial Seneca lake by releasing the heated water, which results in harmful algal blooms and fish deaths (Chant 2021) . Consequently, the application of blockchain technology, which produces environmental pollution, is not conducive to environmental sustainability. Figure 3: Global Cryptocurrencies Proportion (Best 2021) Perspective 2: Government Management: Should we apply blockchain technology to government management? Pro: Yeji Hwang Although applying blockchain technology cannot eliminate corruption, blockchain governance can provide public services more efficiently. In government management, blockchain can serve as an \u201conline ledger\u201d where data can be verified and reconciled, solving the problem of redundancy and disorganization (Disini & Disini Law Office 2018) . For example, a blockchain-based payment and accounting system can offer \u201ca permanent audit trail and facilitate faster reconciliation\u201d for intragovernmental transfers in the US, which increases efficiency in government management (Boeding and McConkie n.d.) . Additionally, blockchain technology can be used in a wide range of public services to achieve efficiencies, such as marriage registration and voting (Casino, Dasaklis, and Patsakis 2019, 63) . This safe, accessible, and decentralized blockchain platform can reduce costs and bureaucracy, which increases efficiency for marriage registration. Also, the blockchain-based voting system will accelerate the voting process by establishing a decentralized voting platform, reduce election costs and increase democracy by offering an open-source voting system for more accessible voters. In summary, we should apply blockchain technology in government management. Con: Mina Sharon Myoi However, when applying blockchain technology in government management, the regulatory uncertainty remains to be worked out and poses great risks in blockchain governance. The regulatory uncertainty in blockchain governance here contains two perspectives: the first is lacking relevant laws and regulations, and the second is \u201clack of precedent illustrating how existing laws will apply to blockchain applications\u201d ( Navigating Regulatory Uncertainty 2018) . When applying blockchain technology in governmental public services, there will be difficulties in designing supporting policies for this complicated technology and uncertain distributions of responsibility for failures. As a decentralized and self-governing system, blockchain technology has the possibility of running out of control in government management. Pisa and Juden (2017) have warned that the application of blockchain technology in public sectors will \u201chave virtually no control over how that system is governed\u201d. In contrast with the limited costs reduced by applying blockchain technology in governance, the costs of the potential failure and compensation for the failure will be more. So, I don\u2019t think we should apply blockchain technology in government management for regulatory uncertainty. Perspective 3: Ethical Considerations: Are there any ethical considerations when applying blockchain technology? Pro: Zhiyi Chen The core question related to ethical considerations is whether applying blockchain technology is good for human beings. Except for the benefits that the blockchain technology directly brings, such as efficient government services and transparent monitoring system, I think the blockchain application has deep values of propelling society progress and making people think critically on the relationship between human and technology. With the development of technology and the application of blockchain, the original social institutions and structures will be transformed to a distributed and decentralized fashion, which compels people to reform the social superstructure, such as reducing unnecessary bureaucracy and making supportive policies. This transforming process makes people reflect on the limitations and strengths of blockchain technology and reconstruct social systems to perfect society. More importantly, the application of blockchain technology makes people reconsider the relationship between human beings and technology. With critical thoughts, people explore how to use blockchain technology to serve people with fewer risks and how humans control and govern this technology. In conclusion, the application of blockchain technology perfects society and inspires deep thoughts on the human-technology relationship, which has a deeper value for human beings. Con: Taehyung Kim In contrast with your opinion, I think the application of blockchain technology is bad for human beings, as this self-governing system facilitates unconscionable conduct, such as facilitating crime and increasing biases. Because the IP addresses of Bitcoin are only accessible by owners who have login details, criminals can launder money so that authorities will find it difficult to trace the money back ( What Is Bitcoin Laundering 2018) . By nature of anonymity, ease of use, and ability of circulation, criminals use blockchain-based Bitcoin to purchase illicit goods and ransomware attacks ( What Is Bitcoin Laundering 2018) . Also, the developers of Blockchain technology are in a higher position of power and there will be implicit biases when conflicts of interests exist. For example, there is simply no way to know whether the developers of blockchain technology truly have the best interest of the users at heart, just as Facebook\u2019s Libra (Neitz 2020) . Considering the emerging crimes and increasing biases, I don\u2019t think blockchain technology is good for humans and this application causes new problems. Synthesis Perspective 1: Achieving environmental sustainability: Can the blockchain technology application contribute to environmental sustainability? Taemin Lee I believe establishing the blockchain-backed monitoring system helps achieve environmental sustainability by using a transparent and safe transaction record in environmental governance. The transaction of cash flow and donation will be free of corruption and be used to solve environmental problems directly. But the premise of this monitoring system is to narrow the digital gap and education gap by making equipment accessible and educate people on how to use this monitoring system (the detailed solution will be shared by Zhiyi) so that people can get access to this monitoring system with equal chances for environmental governance. For the problem of generating electronic waste and causing thermal water pollution, I think the shift from the proof-of-work system to the proof-of-stake system is an effective solution. Without the mining mechanism, this blockchain-backed process will be sustainable (Stevens 2020) . And it\u2019s necessary to use more environmentally-friendly cryptocurrencies, such as EOS and Cardano, in the global market. Also, governments should make specific environmental policies to manage electronic waste generated by Bitcoin, such as recycling and disposing of properly and establish water releasing standards for Bitcoin companies to avoid thermal water pollution. Seulgi Kang Replacing the proof-of-work mechanism with the proof-of-stake mechanism in blockchain-backed cryptocurrencies will contribute to environmental sustainability. However, even if this proof-of-stake mechanism has clear advantages over mining, the transition from an established network to a new consensus mechanism will be difficult (Reiff n.d.) . According to CoinDesk\u2019s report, the rush upgrade to a proof-of-stake blockchain of Ethereum causes disputes among miners (Foxley and Kim 2021) . So, both Ethereum developers and miners should reach a mutually beneficial agreement and work together towards environmental sustainability. As for the problem of energy consumption and greenhouse gas emission, Bitcoin companies can use electricity generated by renewable and clean energy, such as wind, water, and solar power, instead. El Salvador plans to use electricity generated from volcanoes to mine Bitcoin (Hernandez 2021) . To reduce carbon emission in the traditional energy generation, the national government can impose a carbon tax \u201con energy sources that emit carbon dioxide\u201d (Tsai 2020) , which internalizes the negative externality of carbon emission. Also, the government can invite Bitcoin companies to the carbon market by setting carbon emission targets and establishing the carbon emission trading system for Bitcoin companies, which will be conducive for environmental sustainability. Perspective 2: Government Management: Should we apply blockchain technology to government management? Mina Sharon Myoi By nature of transparency and safety, blockchain technology can be used as a powerful tool to fight against corruption and gain people\u2019s confidence in the government. However, to establish a clean-fingered government, blockchain governance still requires supervision systems and institutions that ensure the veracity of the information (detailed solutions will be offered by Yeji Hwang). To solve the problem of regulatory uncertainty and achieve efficiency in blockchain governance, the following solutions are offered. Firstly, establish a private blockchain platform with permissions for public services in blockchain governance. This platform will be supervised by trusted validators and distributed in a controlled way, so that the government can control the master ledger and data entry (Santiso 2018) . Secondly, develop a well-established system for blockchain governance, including making application standards for blockchain technology, adopting financial insurance for blockchain applications, and formulating blockchain-related laws. Thirdly, analyze the conflicts and implications between blockchain technology and existing laws and regulations for blockchain governance. With experts studying laws and blockchain technology, try to think of possible ways that it can comply with existing regulations. Yeji Hwang Applying blockchain technology in government management will achieve great efficiency by reducing governance costs and bureaucracy. Blockchain governance should be widely used in public services for solving the problem of regulatory uncertainty, which is discussed by Mina. However, the shift to this updated and efficient governance system will cause unavoidable problems, such as reducing the staff. Under this circumstance, the government should make supportive policies for this shift, such as offering new job opportunities for re-employment. For the problem of unreliable first data entries, there should be a gatekeeper to ensure the veracity of the information entered into individual blockchains (Santiso 2018) . Possible solutions are establishing a supervisory bureaucracy that audits the data entries and using a job rotation system, in which workers will input different categories of socio-economic data. And these workers will never know the data category until they start working. Also, there should be an office for the public to report suspicious data and information. Perspective 3: Ethical Considerations: Are there any ethical considerations when applying blockchain technology? Taehyung Kim By solving the problem of limited access, the blockchain application can contribute to equality by offering a platform where more people can get access to it. The education, digital and language gaps that Zhiyi has mentioned will also motivate people to learn blockchain technology, to offer digital equipment and learn English as well. For the ethical problem of crimes and bias power, solutions, such as developing new programs for traceability and cracking anonymity, establishing ethical standards for applying blockchain technology, and enacting laws for blockchain crimes, will be helpful. However, I think the best solution for these ethical problems is human awareness of ethics and conscience. As Kenneth Arrow has discussed, moral obligations \u201chave the fundamental role in a society\u201d (Cato and Lutz 2018, 21) and are \u201cvery important to overcome failures of market economies\u201d (1) . Only when people treat others with equality, conscience, care, and morality, can these ethical problems be solved totally when applying blockchain technology. Author: Zhiyi Chen Figure 4: Zhiyi Chen Abandoning the ideology of Pragmatism and Utilitarianism, I think applying blockchain technology brings more intrinsic value for human beings beyond simply achieving environmental sustainability and government management. The application of blockchain technology makes human beings, who have critical thoughts, reform society and reconsider the human-technology relationship. The limitations and strengths of blockchain technology make people reflect and inspire them for further exploration. However, to realize the ethical values of blockchain technology, people should first narrow down the education, digital, and language gap. The first thing that should be done is to enhance infrastructure construction by making equipment accessible and offering a stable network. International governmental organizations, such as the United Nations and the World Bank, and international non-governmental organizations could offer financial and technical support for infrastructure construction. When the digital gap is narrowed down, people can use online courses to learn blockchain technology and English. Also, volunteers who are fluent in English and specialists in blockchain technology can help people who plan to apply the technology.

Blockchain technology is the key to decentralized finance (Harvey, Ramachandran, and Santoro 2021, 13) , which enables cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ether, and applications such as Smart Contracts. The application of blockchain technology appears in various fields, as shown in Figure 2, and offers efficient and transparent solutions to emerging problems in those fields. Various scholars and researchers analyze its limitations, such as governance and regulation risks, and its strengths, such as privacy and safety. Fulfilling gaps between theory and application, overcoming application limitations, and exploring new application directions are important goals of applying blockchain technology, motivating people to study further.

Pro: Taemin Lee In my opinion, the application of blockchain technology plays an important role in achieving environmental sustainability by establishing a transparent and trusted monitoring system to record the transaction history of cash flow in environmental governance. Due to the decentralized nature of blockchain technology, all transactions could be transparently observed in this monitoring system \u201cby either having a personal node or by using blockchain explorers\u201d (Conway n.d.) . This monitoring system is trusted, as new \u201cblocks\u201d (referring to new transaction history here) are added to the end of the blockchain chronologically and it will be difficult to alter previous transaction history without a majority consensus (Conway n.d.) . Consequently, for both governmental organizations and non-governmental organizations, this transparent and trusted system, which is free of fraud and tampering, can ensure the cash and donations get to beneficiaries who need the money most and solve environmental problems, such as managing climate change, with clean hands. The United Nations has just illustrated the successful pilot program of this monitoring system in Pakistan and identified applying blockchain technology as a sustainable solution to the environmental crisis ( Sustainability Solution or Climate Calamity 2021) . So, I think the application of blockchain technology will contribute to environmental sustainability. Con: Seulgi Kang Although blockchain technology can contribute to environmental sustainability by establishing a monitoring system to record transaction history, the blockchain-backed cryptocurrency, such as Bitcoin and Ether, consumes a staggering amount of energy for mining. By the nature of the proof-of-work system, the mining process is like a computational race, which can only be achieved by solving complex mathematical problems with high-powered computers (Frankenfield n.d.) . BBC has reported that Bitcoin uses around 121.36 Terawatt-hours of electricity per year, consuming more energy than Argentina (Criddle 2021) . According to Digiconomist, the annualized total Ethereum footprint is comparable to the power consumption of Chile and the carbon footprint of Trinidad and Tobago (Ethereum Energy Consumption Index n.d.) . Also, because the major portion of the global energy is powered by fossil-fueled power plants, this staggering energy consumption will be responsible for greenhouse gas emissions and global climate change, which is not conducive for environmental sustainability.

Considering the emerging crimes and increasing biases, I don\u2019t think blockchain technology is good for humans and this application causes new problems.","title":"Antithesis"},{"location":"articles/Research/TheApplicationofBlockchainTechnology%3AEnvironmentalSustainabilityGovernmentManagementandEthicalConsiderations/#synthesis","text":"Perspective 1: Achieving environmental sustainability: Can the blockchain technology application contribute to environmental sustainability? Taemin Lee I believe establishing the blockchain-backed monitoring system helps achieve environmental sustainability by using a transparent and safe transaction record in environmental governance. The transaction of cash flow and donation will be free of corruption and be used to solve environmental problems directly. But the premise of this monitoring system is to narrow the digital gap and education gap by making equipment accessible and educate people on how to use this monitoring system (the detailed solution will be shared by Zhiyi) so that people can get access to this monitoring system with equal chances for environmental governance. For the problem of generating electronic waste and causing thermal water pollution, I think the shift from the proof-of-work system to the proof-of-stake system is an effective solution. Without the mining mechanism, this blockchain-backed process will be sustainable (Stevens 2020) . And it\u2019s necessary to use more environmentally-friendly cryptocurrencies, such as EOS and Cardano, in the global market. Also, governments should make specific environmental policies to manage electronic waste generated by Bitcoin, such as recycling and disposing of properly and establish water releasing standards for Bitcoin companies to avoid thermal water pollution. Seulgi Kang Replacing the proof-of-work mechanism with the proof-of-stake mechanism in blockchain-backed cryptocurrencies will contribute to environmental sustainability. However, even if this proof-of-stake mechanism has clear advantages over mining, the transition from an established network to a new consensus mechanism will be difficult (Reiff n.d.) . According to CoinDesk\u2019s report, the rush upgrade to a proof-of-stake blockchain of Ethereum causes disputes among miners (Foxley and Kim 2021) . So, both Ethereum developers and miners should reach a mutually beneficial agreement and work together towards environmental sustainability. As for the problem of energy consumption and greenhouse gas emission, Bitcoin companies can use electricity generated by renewable and clean energy, such as wind, water, and solar power, instead. El Salvador plans to use electricity generated from volcanoes to mine Bitcoin (Hernandez 2021) . To reduce carbon emission in the traditional energy generation, the national government can impose a carbon tax \u201con energy sources that emit carbon dioxide\u201d (Tsai 2020) , which internalizes the negative externality of carbon emission. Also, the government can invite Bitcoin companies to the carbon market by setting carbon emission targets and establishing the carbon emission trading system for Bitcoin companies, which will be conducive for environmental sustainability. Perspective 2: Government Management: Should we apply blockchain technology to government management? Mina Sharon Myoi By nature of transparency and safety, blockchain technology can be used as a powerful tool to fight against corruption and gain people\u2019s confidence in the government. However, to establish a clean-fingered government, blockchain governance still requires supervision systems and institutions that ensure the veracity of the information (detailed solutions will be offered by Yeji Hwang). To solve the problem of regulatory uncertainty and achieve efficiency in blockchain governance, the following solutions are offered. Firstly, establish a private blockchain platform with permissions for public services in blockchain governance. This platform will be supervised by trusted validators and distributed in a controlled way, so that the government can control the master ledger and data entry (Santiso 2018) . Secondly, develop a well-established system for blockchain governance, including making application standards for blockchain technology, adopting financial insurance for blockchain applications, and formulating blockchain-related laws. Thirdly, analyze the conflicts and implications between blockchain technology and existing laws and regulations for blockchain governance. With experts studying laws and blockchain technology, try to think of possible ways that it can comply with existing regulations. Yeji Hwang Applying blockchain technology in government management will achieve great efficiency by reducing governance costs and bureaucracy. Blockchain governance should be widely used in public services for solving the problem of regulatory uncertainty, which is discussed by Mina. However, the shift to this updated and efficient governance system will cause unavoidable problems, such as reducing the staff. Under this circumstance, the government should make supportive policies for this shift, such as offering new job opportunities for re-employment. For the problem of unreliable first data entries, there should be a gatekeeper to ensure the veracity of the information entered into individual blockchains (Santiso 2018) . Possible solutions are establishing a supervisory bureaucracy that audits the data entries and using a job rotation system, in which workers will input different categories of socio-economic data. And these workers will never know the data category until they start working. Also, there should be an office for the public to report suspicious data and information. Perspective 3: Ethical Considerations: Are there any ethical considerations when applying blockchain technology? Taehyung Kim By solving the problem of limited access, the blockchain application can contribute to equality by offering a platform where more people can get access to it. The education, digital and language gaps that Zhiyi has mentioned will also motivate people to learn blockchain technology, to offer digital equipment and learn English as well. For the ethical problem of crimes and bias power, solutions, such as developing new programs for traceability and cracking anonymity, establishing ethical standards for applying blockchain technology, and enacting laws for blockchain crimes, will be helpful. However, I think the best solution for these ethical problems is human awareness of ethics and conscience. As Kenneth Arrow has discussed, moral obligations \u201chave the fundamental role in a society\u201d (Cato and Lutz 2018, 21) and are \u201cvery important to overcome failures of market economies\u201d (1) . Only when people treat others with equality, conscience, care, and morality, can these ethical problems be solved totally when applying blockchain technology.","title":"Synthesis"},{"location":"articles/Research/TheApplicationofBlockchainTechnology%3AEnvironmentalSustainabilityGovernmentManagementandEthicalConsiderations/#author","text":"Zhiyi Chen Figure 4: Zhiyi Chen Abandoning the ideology of Pragmatism and Utilitarianism, I think applying blockchain technology brings more intrinsic value for human beings beyond simply achieving environmental sustainability and government management. The application of blockchain technology makes human beings, who have critical thoughts, reform society and reconsider the human-technology relationship. The limitations and strengths of blockchain technology make people reflect and inspire them for further exploration. However, to realize the ethical values of blockchain technology, people should first narrow down the education, digital, and language gap. The first thing that should be done is to enhance infrastructure construction by making equipment accessible and offering a stable network. International governmental organizations, such as the United Nations and the World Bank, and international non-governmental organizations could offer financial and technical support for infrastructure construction. When the digital gap is narrowed down, people can use online courses to learn blockchain technology and English. Also, volunteers who are fluent in English and specialists in blockchain technology can help people who plan to apply the technology.","title":"Author:"},{"location":"articles/Research/TheApplicationofBlockchainTechnology%3AEnvironmentalSustainabilityGovernmentManagementandEthicalConsiderations/#relevant-materials","text":"[1]Duke Kunshan is a world-class liberal arts university based in Kunshan, China, that offers a range of high-quality, innovative academic programs for students from around the world.

Before we proceed with our debate, let us first define a few key terms. What is a blockchain, and how does it work? A blockchain is a distributed database that is updated and shared across a network of computers. Ethereum is a network powered by the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), where network members check, confirm, and \u201cexecute\u201d the computation whenever a request is broadcast. Ethereum\u2019s native cryptocurrency is Ether (ETH). Users pay other users in Ether to have their code execution requests completed. \u201c Smart contract \u201d is software that runs on Ethereum\u2019s blockchain. It is a collection of code (its functions) and data (its state) that lives on the Ethereum blockchain at a single address. Our debate will examine Ethereum from three perspectives: applications, economics, and legislation. Our debaters will begin by discussing technological advancements that will make Ethereum easier, safer, and more private, as well as the concerns associated with its composability characteristic. Our debate teams will then address economic considerations such as the cost of the bug and transaction fees, which might harm ETH profits. It is a debate over whether the benefits of Ethereum will outweigh the risks that will determine Ethereum\u2019s long-term viability. Finally, our debaters will debate the government\u2019s regulatory policies and potential conflicts with Ethereum firms during Ethereum\u2019s development to evaluate if Ethereum will endure. Debating Session 1: Thesis \u2014 DeFi Ethereum will last long Perspective 1 (Applications) Figure 1: The difference between apps and DApps Figure 2: DApp market transactions Pro: Annie: DApps\u2019 broad application is the best support for Ethereum\u2019s long-term growth since, like apps need the Internet, DApps rely on the Ethereum blockchain to function. DApps could increase transaction security by accessing the Ethereum blockchain. Backend code (smart contracts) for decentralized applications or \u201cDApps\u201d is operated on a decentralized network rather than a centralized server, as Figure 1 shows. It has no downtime, which means that once the smart contract is implemented on the blockchain, the network will always be available to clients that want to interact with it. This transaction order would execute code immediately, preventing hackers from launching denial-of-service attacks against DApps. Smart contracts can be evaluated and guaranteed to operate in predictable ways throughout DApps\u2019 applications without relying on a central authority like the traditional banking system. In this case, DApps are a more straightforward, safer, and private Ethereum area that will gain consumers\u2019 trust in utilizing the blockchain in the future. From Figure 2, we can tell millions of active users using DApps with hundreds of millions of transactions every month ( Wright 2020 ). Maintaining this volume, Ethereum will become prosperous. Con: Bill: We need a super high level of technology to provide a more straightforward, safer, and more privatized Ethereum environment to protect our peer-to-peer transactions, which is a huge performance overhead. Ethereum has to perform and store every transaction to achieve the security, integrity, transparency, and dependability that it aims to, which becomes a challenge as the scope of Ethereum\u2019s business grows. Furthermore, proof-of-work requires time to achieve. According to a back-of-the-envelope estimate, the overhead is presently 1,000,000x that of normal computing, which is unlikely to be completed shortly ( \u201cIntroduction to DApps\u201d 2021 ). Besides, Ethereum may end up appearing like centralized services anyhow. For example, before publishing to the blockchain, Ethereum may store keys or other sensitive information on a centralized server, provide a frontend using a centralized server, or perform essential business logic on a centralized server. Many (if not all) of the advantages of blockchain over the traditional model are lost due to centralized control. Perspective 2 (Economics\uff09 Figure 3: Price performance of Bitcoin and Ethereum compared with other coins Pro: Cathy The fast growth and dissemination of Ethereum applications are due to enormous financial gains. Based on the Ethereum blockchain, Ether is valued more than ten times at the bottom of the COVID market panic in March 2020. The cryptocurrency has barely been around for five years! Figure 3 displays the rising price performance of ETH, excelling from Bitcoins and the average. Because of ETH\u2019s remarkable surge in value, excess money from agencies and corporations is now viewed as a reasonably safe store-of-value asset and suitable speculative investment. Figure 4: Stimulus check investment of Bitcoin, Ethereum, S&P, and Gold Ethereum beats Bitcoin and other cryptos, becoming where most cryptocurrency activity takes place (Figure 4) ( Spilotro 2020 ). DeFi, as the application of Ethereum blockchain, eliminates the intermediary, which saves procedures and time cost doing transactions. Users can use the Compound and Yearn Finance protocols to borrow, trade, lend, and invest via autonomous smart contracts. Currently, over US$24 billion is invested in various DeFi initiatives ( Sandner 2020 ). DeFi, in particular, allows users to profit from their cryptocurrency holdings, particularly ether tokens. More investment in the Ethereum blockchain will result in more profit for the investing firms. For the betterment of Ethereum, the virtuous loop continues to spin. Con: Dorothy Figure 5: Ethereum price analysis High risks usually accompany high rewards, and high risks carry a more considerable danger of loss. Every seasoned cryptocurrency user understands that Bitcoin or Ether is highly volatile and is just as likely to collapse as it is to rise ( Chavez-dreyfuss 2021 ). After the last bull market in 2017, Bitcoin\u2019s price has dropped by 85% this year, while Ether\u2019s price has dropped by 95% from its previous high of US$1,428 ( Kavanagh and Dylan-Ennis 2021 ). This data indicates that there is a significant chance of incurring a possible expense in an Ether investment. Like the broken line in Figure 5, once you gain from the top-up price of ETH and the next second, you may find a roller coaster to the bottom down with a significant loss ( Sheikh 2020 ). Meanwhile, Ethereum network problems cost money. Rival blockchains called \u201cEthereum killers\u201d exploit Ethereum\u2019s flaws, which will almost certainly cost investors money ( Newbery 2021 ). After someone exploited a defect in the software that most users use to connect to the blockchain, Ethereum split into two different chains in late August 2021. It was unclear for a while whether the split would result in a \u201cdouble-spend attack,\u201d in which the same token might be spent several times and transactions reversed ( Comben 2019 ). Because flaws are unavoidable, when the dangers outweigh the benefits of the Ethereum blockchain, users will migrate to alternative platforms, resulting in Ethereum\u2019s demise. Perspective 3 (Regulations) Pro: Eve Regulations for the Ethereum market may help to reduce the market\u2019s instability and unpredictability. While long-time cryptocurrency investors bemoan the prospect of regulation restricting the market\u2019s present independence, significant investors and corporations see the inevitable implementation of such regulations as a source of stability that may lead to widespread adoption. Our governments\u2019 actions have already been taken. A congressional committee in the United States has been formed to look into digital currencies. Banks are asked to give paperwork on how to use them and examine guidelines on cryptocurrencies. The Securities and Exchange Commission chairman in the United States has warned undesirable actors about enforcement and regulation ( Falach 2018 ). The Ethereum system will endure a long time with sustainable development thanks to Ethereum firms and our government laws. Con: Fairy Though governments tend to regulate the Ethereum blockchain, which department should oversee both cryptocurrencies and the Ethereum platform is debatable because it is unclear what Ether counts. Two federal regulatory authorities in the United States have different definitions of what a cryptocurrency is. ETH has been classified as commodities by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, so they\u2019re not regulated by the SEC ( Rooney 2018 ). In contrast, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has the authority to regulate ETH and other cryptocurrencies, and the first U.S. bitcoin futures exchange-traded funds are expected to begin trading soon. The new Ethereum blockchain has a bright future for trade, thus new regulations are required, and the market would be chaotic without them. Debating Session 2: Antithesis \u2014 Ethereum network will not last long Perspective 1 (Applications) Pro: Bill: We have debated about Ethereum\u2019s significant risks in terms of application technologies and market transaction costs. Hacks and the volatility of Ethereum\u2019s price highlight how non-linear all major public blockchains are, implying that they are managed by an open-source community that must be majority aligned in principle and techniques to maintain chain performance ( Richter, 2021 ). Decentralization which does not have a central authority comes with all of its costs and risks. As a result, adopting the Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDC) ( https://cbdctracker.org/ ), which has already been a new form of using the network that makes our lives easier, is the most credible method to ensure transaction safety. As we can tell, the proportion of CBDC activity increases in Figure 6. Why use Ethereum, which is considerably riskier? Figure 6: Share of respondents conducting work on CBDCs % Con: Annie: I do not entirely agree with Bill\u2019s assertion. We cannot stop innovating because the risk is too high. Because of Ethereum, we continue to update when bugs are discovered and our techniques improve. Ethereum has survived a software glitch that led the world\u2019s most popular blockchain to split, indicating that it can withstand and flourish in the face of adversity ( Sigalos 2021 ). \u201cUsers reduced the harm by quickly upgrading a key software, and the deviant fork should be gone,\u201d Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin stated. Attempts to exploit the bug were made, and the developers immediately updated the software. It\u2019s also that Ethereum yields far more money than CBDC, which may explain why individuals are eager to enhance this new technology. We need the process of experiencing and resolving issues towards innovation. That is the test that any new technology must pass to proceed in the long run. Perspective 2 (Economics) Pro: Dorothy: Figure 7: Bitcoin vs. Ethereum daily transaction fees In the Ethereum blockchain application, high transaction costs are one of the primary reasons why investors are hesitant to use the Ethereum network. The number paid in Ethereum transaction fees outstripped the amount paid in top one bitcoin transaction costs, totaling $298,000. Nonetheless, as seen in Figure 7, ETH fees have been sharply increasing. According to data provided by The Block, the number of Compound liquidations peaked on March 12, 2020, with the bulk of those liquidations taking the form of ETH. Twenty-four hours prior to data collection, $4.19 million in ETH and about $120,000 in USDC stablecoin had been liquidated. Furthermore, according to Dune Analytics, Ethereum blockchain failure caused 2% to 5% of transactions on Ethereum-based decentralized exchanges to fail. That failure is so costly. On October 13, 2021, an Ethereum user attempting to engage in an activity called Strips MISO token auction in Ethereum blockchain paid $430,000 in fees for a failed transaction. They also spent $105,000 to cancel a second transaction after the first one failed ( Copeland 2021 ). Con: Cathy: As the Ethereum network matures, the cost of rejected transactions could be reduced via innovation. In 2016, a collection of smart contracts known as \u201cThe DAO \u201d earned a record US$150 million in a public sale, but one-third of the assets were stolen by a hacker ( Kavanagh and Dylan-Ennis 2021 ). The loss has allowed the Ethereum ecosystem to grow significantly since then. While hacking and frauds are still prevalent, the general degree of professionalism appears to have much improved. I agree with Annie, who stated in the previous debate that risks should not be used as an excuse to stop innovating. It is acceptable for Ethereum blockchain to have risks as a newborn innovation; as long as the technology improves from the vulnerabilities, allowing the advantages to outweigh the costs, its future would be bright. Perspective 3 (Regulations) Pro: Fairy The Ethereum blockchain businesses cannot expand and scale to their full potential without clear regulations and laws because no one dares to move without understanding the boundaries of restriction and legality. Ether classified as commodities or securities is under different apartments\u2019 custody, as noted in the earlier argument over the ambiguous custody from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and SEC department. The Ethereum industry has been at a standstill since the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) decided that neither Bitcoin (BTC) nor Ethereum (ETH) was securities in 2019. According to this declaration, cryptocurrencies should be seen as commodities, although the Ethereum blockchain has more potential applications than a limited-use product. Although the market is considerably broader, blockchain innovation will be limited to only the development of currencies in this circumstance. The Ethereum market\u2019s potential to make additional derivatives in the application is limited within the categorization to fit regulation. Con: Eve: Rather than fighting endlessly over Ethereum\u2019s custodial rights, we should first discuss whether or not we want regulation and, if so, in what form. Government regulation of the Ethereum blockchain might improve transactions, although it is not required at this time since the government\u2019s ability in a decentralized society is restricted. Only two areas of regulation are more urgently needed: tax reporting to balance profits obtained and regulating initial coin offers (ICOs) to prevent fraud during transactions ( Edmondson 2018 ). The regulation could focus on these two areas to accelerate the release of the policy. As a result, whether or not the cryptocurrency market is regulated will remain highly speculative. Before entering a cryptocurrency position, investors should consider their investment goals and risk tolerance. Companies should continue to collaborate with the government, regardless of how legislators and regulators handle the challenges. The objective is to ensure that the rapidly expanding number of individuals who utilize fintech and Ethereum blockchain technologies continue to receive best-in-class solutions with enough consumer and market protections. Conclusion: Synthesis \u2014 how could we utilize the Pros and overcome the Cons? Perspective 1 (Applications) Pro: Annie: My main point is that innovations allow firms to take the chance to be the first to enter the Ethereum market, bringing \u201cnew blood\u201d to Ethereum applications. Because anyone could build applications on the network, Microsoft, Imogen Heap, and Deloitte have all expressed interest in the ecosystem. To build up their blockchain, Microsoft created the Ethereum Consortium Blockchain Network on Azure in 2016. But it wasn\u2019t Ethereum\u2019s only activity in 2016. The DAO, which crowdfunded a $150 million investment fund earlier this year, was one of the most well-known programs built on the network ( \u201cEthereum: Most Innovative Company\u201d 2017 ). That investment was dogged by a hacker, causing the platform to split multiple times to limit the bad actor\u2019s ability to steal funds. As innovation goes on with more investments from influential firms, Ethereum\u2019s future is bright, and all the risks problems shall be fixed up. Con: Bill: More firms investing in Ethereum blockchain, or \u201cfresh blood,\u201d as Annie puts it, is a positive sign for Ethereum, but it also causes technical issues that may bring the system down. Scalability is currently a significant issue with the Ethereum network. The popularity of the Ethereum-based game CryptoKitties, for example, caused the network to become highly congested in 2017, considerably delaying trading. Due to congestion on the Ethereum network, an online casino had to lock its doors earlier this year briefly. The news broke when KingTiger Casino\u2019s official website announced the company\u2019s temporary shutdown of services on February 26. With more examples of closure in the Ethereum company, the cryptocurrency will undoubtedly gain a poor image, causing investors to be skeptical of the new technology. Perspective 2 (Economics) Pro: Cathy Ethereum will endure as long as the benefits of Ethereum outweigh the costs of risks since everyone wants to make more money. Despite the significant risk associated with Ethereum, this does not stop investors from investing. Since December 2020, the number of unique Ethereum users has tripled. According to statistics from Dune Analytics, the total number of unique addresses interacting with DeFi Ethereum has surpassed 3 million. As of July 13, the analytics tool has discovered 3,004,620 addresses utilizing at least one of the platform\u2019s 24 applications. With over 2.3 million unique addresses, Ethereum\u2019s largest decentralized exchange, Uniswap, was by far the most popular DeFi protocol. Despite a market-wide sell-off in May, DeFi Ethereum usage has continued to skyrocket. The number of unique addresses increased from 100,000 to one million in around 11 months, but continuing growth is occurring quicker. According to Messari Research Analyst Mason Nystrom on Twitter, the transition from 1 to 2 million took 142 days, whereas the change from 2 to 3 million took only 78 days ( Craig 2021 ). High risks may deter investors, but if they see the potential beneath Ethereum\u2019s present unsteady shield and win more than they lose, this system will endure for a long time. Con: Dorothy Earning profit is a need for attracting new investors into Ethereum, but high transaction costs reduce earnings. High transaction costs are unavoidable, even though technology fosters innovation and reduces the danger of decentralization. A transaction fee, sometimes known as a \u201c network fee ,\u201d is charged every time you move crypto assets from your wallet to another receiving wallet address. The precise amount you pay for each ETH transaction is determined by the network\u2019s consensus protocol and the traffic volume on that network. Ethereum, as the most widely utilized network, will continue to suffer network cost issues. Even while Cryption Network is already working on a platform that enables DeFi users to trade without paying gas costs for the first time, we cannot give any assurances until it is officially launched. High charges will exist for a long time because this is a new technology. As a result, we\u2019ll have to wait and see if Ethereum will survive in the long run. Perspective 3 (Regulations) Pro: Eve The Ethereum blockchain should not be viewed as merely a product, a network, or a currency. It is an advanced decentralized idea. This Ethereum blockchain contains implications that might be a game-changer in terms of integrating high-tech into our daily lives. As a result, debating whether current departments should govern Ethereum is pointless. We could let the tax department write new regulations if we notice taxes that require policies to balance profits. When well-designed, ETH\u2019s Initial coin offerings (ICOs) can offer greater security, liquidity, and transparency than traditional finance mechanisms. These qualities have the potential to reduce the costs of asymmetric information and agency difficulties, which could save some conventional regulation. Also, because we want this system to be distinct from the old centralized one with more transaction independence, decentralization should not intervene significantly. Con: Fairy Even if agencies exist to provide clear regulatory principles, the level of regulation will be a source of debate between governments and companies. Despite the fact that many businesses recognize the necessity for external influence, tech corporations would negotiate with the government to establish less strict regulations when it comes to profit. Negotiation takes time, which may cause Ethereum\u2019s progress to be delayed because the system\u2019s operation is debatable when various parties are involved. Many agencies have acknowledged the dangers of overregulation and warned lawmakers against enacting legislation encouraging foreign investment in the technology. How much should our government interfere to preserve the benefits of decentralization? Is it feasible for the capital of Ethereum enterprises to influence market policy? Ethereum might perish amid a standoff about who and how to regulate with the government and society. Let me ask you, the readers: Do we want to retain Ethereum the way it is and rely on developers to make the final decision? Or do we want to use decentralized, rule-based, and automated voting methods to return power to all stakeholders on the blockchain? Do you believe Ethereum will be around for a long time?

Finally, our debaters will debate the government\u2019s regulatory policies and potential conflicts with Ethereum firms during Ethereum\u2019s development to evaluate if Ethereum will endure.","title":"Opening Remarks"},{"location":"articles/Research/WillEthereumlastlong/#debating-session-1-thesis","text":"\u2014 DeFi Ethereum will last long","title":"Debating Session 1: Thesis"},{"location":"articles/Research/WillEthereumlastlong/#perspective-1-applications","text":"Figure 1: The difference between apps and DApps Figure 2: DApp market transactions Pro: Annie: DApps\u2019 broad application is the best support for Ethereum\u2019s long-term growth since, like apps need the Internet, DApps rely on the Ethereum blockchain to function. DApps could increase transaction security by accessing the Ethereum blockchain. Backend code (smart contracts) for decentralized applications or \u201cDApps\u201d is operated on a decentralized network rather than a centralized server, as Figure 1 shows. It has no downtime, which means that once the smart contract is implemented on the blockchain, the network will always be available to clients that want to interact with it. This transaction order would execute code immediately, preventing hackers from launching denial-of-service attacks against DApps. Smart contracts can be evaluated and guaranteed to operate in predictable ways throughout DApps\u2019 applications without relying on a central authority like the traditional banking system. In this case, DApps are a more straightforward, safer, and private Ethereum area that will gain consumers\u2019 trust in utilizing the blockchain in the future. From Figure 2, we can tell millions of active users using DApps with hundreds of millions of transactions every month ( Wright 2020 ). Maintaining this volume, Ethereum will become prosperous. Con: Bill: We need a super high level of technology to provide a more straightforward, safer, and more privatized Ethereum environment to protect our peer-to-peer transactions, which is a huge performance overhead. Ethereum has to perform and store every transaction to achieve the security, integrity, transparency, and dependability that it aims to, which becomes a challenge as the scope of Ethereum\u2019s business grows. Furthermore, proof-of-work requires time to achieve. According to a back-of-the-envelope estimate, the overhead is presently 1,000,000x that of normal computing, which is unlikely to be completed shortly ( \u201cIntroduction to DApps\u201d 2021 ). Besides, Ethereum may end up appearing like centralized services anyhow. For example, before publishing to the blockchain, Ethereum may store keys or other sensitive information on a centralized server, provide a frontend using a centralized server, or perform essential business logic on a centralized server. Many (if not all) of the advantages of blockchain over the traditional model are lost due to centralized control.","title":"Perspective 1 (Applications)"},{"location":"articles/Research/WillEthereumlastlong/#perspective-2-economics","text":"Figure 3: Price performance of Bitcoin and Ethereum compared with other coins Pro: Cathy The fast growth and dissemination of Ethereum applications are due to enormous financial gains. Based on the Ethereum blockchain, Ether is valued more than ten times at the bottom of the COVID market panic in March 2020. The cryptocurrency has barely been around for five years! Figure 3 displays the rising price performance of ETH, excelling from Bitcoins and the average. Because of ETH\u2019s remarkable surge in value, excess money from agencies and corporations is now viewed as a reasonably safe store-of-value asset and suitable speculative investment. Figure 4: Stimulus check investment of Bitcoin, Ethereum, S&P, and Gold Ethereum beats Bitcoin and other cryptos, becoming where most cryptocurrency activity takes place (Figure 4) ( Spilotro 2020 ). DeFi, as the application of Ethereum blockchain, eliminates the intermediary, which saves procedures and time cost doing transactions. Users can use the Compound and Yearn Finance protocols to borrow, trade, lend, and invest via autonomous smart contracts. Currently, over US$24 billion is invested in various DeFi initiatives ( Sandner 2020 ). DeFi, in particular, allows users to profit from their cryptocurrency holdings, particularly ether tokens. More investment in the Ethereum blockchain will result in more profit for the investing firms. For the betterment of Ethereum, the virtuous loop continues to spin. Con: Dorothy Figure 5: Ethereum price analysis High risks usually accompany high rewards, and high risks carry a more considerable danger of loss. Every seasoned cryptocurrency user understands that Bitcoin or Ether is highly volatile and is just as likely to collapse as it is to rise ( Chavez-dreyfuss 2021 ). After the last bull market in 2017, Bitcoin\u2019s price has dropped by 85% this year, while Ether\u2019s price has dropped by 95% from its previous high of US$1,428 ( Kavanagh and Dylan-Ennis 2021 ). This data indicates that there is a significant chance of incurring a possible expense in an Ether investment. Like the broken line in Figure 5, once you gain from the top-up price of ETH and the next second, you may find a roller coaster to the bottom down with a significant loss ( Sheikh 2020 ). Meanwhile, Ethereum network problems cost money. Rival blockchains called \u201cEthereum killers\u201d exploit Ethereum\u2019s flaws, which will almost certainly cost investors money ( Newbery 2021 ). After someone exploited a defect in the software that most users use to connect to the blockchain, Ethereum split into two different chains in late August 2021. It was unclear for a while whether the split would result in a \u201cdouble-spend attack,\u201d in which the same token might be spent several times and transactions reversed ( Comben 2019 ). Because flaws are unavoidable, when the dangers outweigh the benefits of the Ethereum blockchain, users will migrate to alternative platforms, resulting in Ethereum\u2019s demise.","title":"Perspective 2 (Economics\uff09"},{"location":"articles/Research/WillEthereumlastlong/#perspective-3-regulations","text":"Pro: Eve Regulations for the Ethereum market may help to reduce the market\u2019s instability and unpredictability. While long-time cryptocurrency investors bemoan the prospect of regulation restricting the market\u2019s present independence, significant investors and corporations see the inevitable implementation of such regulations as a source of stability that may lead to widespread adoption. Our governments\u2019 actions have already been taken. A congressional committee in the United States has been formed to look into digital currencies. Banks are asked to give paperwork on how to use them and examine guidelines on cryptocurrencies. The Securities and Exchange Commission chairman in the United States has warned undesirable actors about enforcement and regulation ( Falach 2018 ). The Ethereum system will endure a long time with sustainable development thanks to Ethereum firms and our government laws. Con: Fairy Though governments tend to regulate the Ethereum blockchain, which department should oversee both cryptocurrencies and the Ethereum platform is debatable because it is unclear what Ether counts. Two federal regulatory authorities in the United States have different definitions of what a cryptocurrency is. ETH has been classified as commodities by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, so they\u2019re not regulated by the SEC ( Rooney 2018 ). In contrast, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has the authority to regulate ETH and other cryptocurrencies, and the first U.S. bitcoin futures exchange-traded funds are expected to begin trading soon. The new Ethereum blockchain has a bright future for trade, thus new regulations are required, and the market would be chaotic without them.","title":"Perspective 3 (Regulations)"},{"location":"articles/Research/WillEthereumlastlong/#debating-session-2-antithesis","text":"\u2014 Ethereum network will not last long","title":"Debating Session 2: Antithesis"},{"location":"articles/Research/WillEthereumlastlong/#perspective-1-applications_1","text":"Pro: Bill: We have debated about Ethereum\u2019s significant risks in terms of application technologies and market transaction costs. Hacks and the volatility of Ethereum\u2019s price highlight how non-linear all major public blockchains are, implying that they are managed by an open-source community that must be majority aligned in principle and techniques to maintain chain performance ( Richter, 2021 ). Decentralization which does not have a central authority comes with all of its costs and risks. As a result, adopting the Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDC) ( https://cbdctracker.org/ ), which has already been a new form of using the network that makes our lives easier, is the most credible method to ensure transaction safety. As we can tell, the proportion of CBDC activity increases in Figure 6. Why use Ethereum, which is considerably riskier? Figure 6: Share of respondents conducting work on CBDCs % Con: Annie: I do not entirely agree with Bill\u2019s assertion. We cannot stop innovating because the risk is too high. Because of Ethereum, we continue to update when bugs are discovered and our techniques improve. Ethereum has survived a software glitch that led the world\u2019s most popular blockchain to split, indicating that it can withstand and flourish in the face of adversity ( Sigalos 2021 ). \u201cUsers reduced the harm by quickly upgrading a key software, and the deviant fork should be gone,\u201d Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin stated. Attempts to exploit the bug were made, and the developers immediately updated the software. It\u2019s also that Ethereum yields far more money than CBDC, which may explain why individuals are eager to enhance this new technology. We need the process of experiencing and resolving issues towards innovation. That is the test that any new technology must pass to proceed in the long run.","title":"Perspective 1 (Applications)"},{"location":"articles/Research/WillEthereumlastlong/#perspective-2-economics_1","text":"Pro: Dorothy: Figure 7: Bitcoin vs. Ethereum daily transaction fees In the Ethereum blockchain application, high transaction costs are one of the primary reasons why investors are hesitant to use the Ethereum network. The number paid in Ethereum transaction fees outstripped the amount paid in top one bitcoin transaction costs, totaling $298,000. Nonetheless, as seen in Figure 7, ETH fees have been sharply increasing. According to data provided by The Block, the number of Compound liquidations peaked on March 12, 2020, with the bulk of those liquidations taking the form of ETH. Twenty-four hours prior to data collection, $4.19 million in ETH and about $120,000 in USDC stablecoin had been liquidated. Furthermore, according to Dune Analytics, Ethereum blockchain failure caused 2% to 5% of transactions on Ethereum-based decentralized exchanges to fail. That failure is so costly. On October 13, 2021, an Ethereum user attempting to engage in an activity called Strips MISO token auction in Ethereum blockchain paid $430,000 in fees for a failed transaction. They also spent $105,000 to cancel a second transaction after the first one failed ( Copeland 2021 ). Con: Cathy: As the Ethereum network matures, the cost of rejected transactions could be reduced via innovation. In 2016, a collection of smart contracts known as \u201cThe DAO \u201d earned a record US$150 million in a public sale, but one-third of the assets were stolen by a hacker ( Kavanagh and Dylan-Ennis 2021 ). The loss has allowed the Ethereum ecosystem to grow significantly since then. While hacking and frauds are still prevalent, the general degree of professionalism appears to have much improved. I agree with Annie, who stated in the previous debate that risks should not be used as an excuse to stop innovating. It is acceptable for Ethereum blockchain to have risks as a newborn innovation; as long as the technology improves from the vulnerabilities, allowing the advantages to outweigh the costs, its future would be bright.","title":"Perspective 2 (Economics)"},{"location":"articles/Research/WillEthereumlastlong/#perspective-3-regulations_1","text":"Pro: Fairy The Ethereum blockchain businesses cannot expand and scale to their full potential without clear regulations and laws because no one dares to move without understanding the boundaries of restriction and legality. Ether classified as commodities or securities is under different apartments\u2019 custody, as noted in the earlier argument over the ambiguous custody from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and SEC department. The Ethereum industry has been at a standstill since the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) decided that neither Bitcoin (BTC) nor Ethereum (ETH) was securities in 2019. According to this declaration, cryptocurrencies should be seen as commodities, although the Ethereum blockchain has more potential applications than a limited-use product. Although the market is considerably broader, blockchain innovation will be limited to only the development of currencies in this circumstance. The Ethereum market\u2019s potential to make additional derivatives in the application is limited within the categorization to fit regulation. Con: Eve: Rather than fighting endlessly over Ethereum\u2019s custodial rights, we should first discuss whether or not we want regulation and, if so, in what form. Government regulation of the Ethereum blockchain might improve transactions, although it is not required at this time since the government\u2019s ability in a decentralized society is restricted. Only two areas of regulation are more urgently needed: tax reporting to balance profits obtained and regulating initial coin offers (ICOs) to prevent fraud during transactions ( Edmondson 2018 ). The regulation could focus on these two areas to accelerate the release of the policy. As a result, whether or not the cryptocurrency market is regulated will remain highly speculative. Before entering a cryptocurrency position, investors should consider their investment goals and risk tolerance. Companies should continue to collaborate with the government, regardless of how legislators and regulators handle the challenges. The objective is to ensure that the rapidly expanding number of individuals who utilize fintech and Ethereum blockchain technologies continue to receive best-in-class solutions with enough consumer and market protections.","title":"Perspective 3 (Regulations)"},{"location":"articles/Research/WillEthereumlastlong/#conclusion-synthesis","text":"\u2014 how could we utilize the Pros and overcome the Cons?","title":"Conclusion: Synthesis"},{"location":"articles/Research/WillEthereumlastlong/#perspective-1-applications_2","text":"Pro: Annie: My main point is that innovations allow firms to take the chance to be the first to enter the Ethereum market, bringing \u201cnew blood\u201d to Ethereum applications. Because anyone could build applications on the network, Microsoft, Imogen Heap, and Deloitte have all expressed interest in the ecosystem. To build up their blockchain, Microsoft created the Ethereum Consortium Blockchain Network on Azure in 2016. But it wasn\u2019t Ethereum\u2019s only activity in 2016. The DAO, which crowdfunded a $150 million investment fund earlier this year, was one of the most well-known programs built on the network ( \u201cEthereum: Most Innovative Company\u201d 2017 ). That investment was dogged by a hacker, causing the platform to split multiple times to limit the bad actor\u2019s ability to steal funds. As innovation goes on with more investments from influential firms, Ethereum\u2019s future is bright, and all the risks problems shall be fixed up. Con: Bill: More firms investing in Ethereum blockchain, or \u201cfresh blood,\u201d as Annie puts it, is a positive sign for Ethereum, but it also causes technical issues that may bring the system down. Scalability is currently a significant issue with the Ethereum network. The popularity of the Ethereum-based game CryptoKitties, for example, caused the network to become highly congested in 2017, considerably delaying trading. Due to congestion on the Ethereum network, an online casino had to lock its doors earlier this year briefly. The news broke when KingTiger Casino\u2019s official website announced the company\u2019s temporary shutdown of services on February 26. With more examples of closure in the Ethereum company, the cryptocurrency will undoubtedly gain a poor image, causing investors to be skeptical of the new technology.","title":"Perspective 1 (Applications)"},{"location":"articles/Research/WillEthereumlastlong/#perspective-2-economics_2","text":"Pro: Cathy Ethereum will endure as long as the benefits of Ethereum outweigh the costs of risks since everyone wants to make more money. Despite the significant risk associated with Ethereum, this does not stop investors from investing. Since December 2020, the number of unique Ethereum users has tripled. According to statistics from Dune Analytics, the total number of unique addresses interacting with DeFi Ethereum has surpassed 3 million. As of July 13, the analytics tool has discovered 3,004,620 addresses utilizing at least one of the platform\u2019s 24 applications. With over 2.3 million unique addresses, Ethereum\u2019s largest decentralized exchange, Uniswap, was by far the most popular DeFi protocol. Despite a market-wide sell-off in May, DeFi Ethereum usage has continued to skyrocket. The number of unique addresses increased from 100,000 to one million in around 11 months, but continuing growth is occurring quicker. According to Messari Research Analyst Mason Nystrom on Twitter, the transition from 1 to 2 million took 142 days, whereas the change from 2 to 3 million took only 78 days ( Craig 2021 ). High risks may deter investors, but if they see the potential beneath Ethereum\u2019s present unsteady shield and win more than they lose, this system will endure for a long time. Con: Dorothy Earning profit is a need for attracting new investors into Ethereum, but high transaction costs reduce earnings. High transaction costs are unavoidable, even though technology fosters innovation and reduces the danger of decentralization. A transaction fee, sometimes known as a \u201c network fee ,\u201d is charged every time you move crypto assets from your wallet to another receiving wallet address. The precise amount you pay for each ETH transaction is determined by the network\u2019s consensus protocol and the traffic volume on that network. Ethereum, as the most widely utilized network, will continue to suffer network cost issues. Even while Cryption Network is already working on a platform that enables DeFi users to trade without paying gas costs for the first time, we cannot give any assurances until it is officially launched. High charges will exist for a long time because this is a new technology.

It is an advanced decentralized idea. This Ethereum blockchain contains implications that might be a game-changer in terms of integrating high-tech into our daily lives. As a result, debating whether current departments should govern Ethereum is pointless. We could let the tax department write new regulations if we notice taxes that require policies to balance profits. When well-designed, ETH\u2019s Initial coin offerings (ICOs) can offer greater security, liquidity, and transparency than traditional finance mechanisms. These qualities have the potential to reduce the costs of asymmetric information and agency difficulties, which could save some conventional regulation. Also, because we want this system to be distinct from the old centralized one with more transaction independence, decentralization should not intervene significantly. Con: Fairy Even if agencies exist to provide clear regulatory principles, the level of regulation will be a source of debate between governments and companies. Despite the fact that many businesses recognize the necessity for external influence, tech corporations would negotiate with the government to establish less strict regulations when it comes to profit. Negotiation takes time, which may cause Ethereum\u2019s progress to be delayed because the system\u2019s operation is debatable when various parties are involved. Many agencies have acknowledged the dangers of overregulation and warned lawmakers against enacting legislation encouraging foreign investment in the technology. How much should our government interfere to preserve the benefits of decentralization? Is it feasible for the capital of Ethereum enterprises to influence market policy? Ethereum might perish amid a standoff about who and how to regulate with the government and society. Let me ask you, the readers: Do we want to retain Ethereum the way it is and rely on developers to make the final decision?
