Duke CS+ and SciEcon Symposium Documentary

Watch the symposium documentary on [SciEcon YouTube channel](https://youtu.be/YpJCpcUuVBs):

Disclaimer: _This documentary is an extension of the Duke CS+ Project Summer 2021 entitled “_[_Decentralized Finance: Blockchain and Cryptocurrency on the Internet Computer_](https://www.cs.duke.edu/undergrad/summer_research)_.”_

Inspired by [Prof. Campbell Harvey](https://medium.com/sciecon-ama/how-will-defi-reshape-the-future-of-finance-a5febf668487)’s initiatives in DeFi, we are developing research-oriented DeFi Applications on the [Internet Computer](https://internetcomputer.org/). The project lead is [Prof. Luyao Zhang](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sunshineluyao/), Senior Research Scientist at Data Science Research Center and Assistant Professor of Economics at Duke Kunshan University. The co-leads include [Prof. Kartik Nayak](https://users.cs.duke.edu/~kartik/) and [Prof. Fan Zhang](https://www.fanzhang.me/), Assistant Professor of Computer Science at Duke University and industry pioneer [Prof. Yulin Liu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yulineth/), the Partner and Head of Research at [Bochsler Finance](https://bochslerfinance.com/about-us/) and Chief Economists for several DeFi projects. The research team includes graduate mentor [Derrick Adam](https://www.linkedin.com/in/derrick-adam/), a master’s student from the Economics and Computer Science program, and undergraduate researchers [Dylan Paul](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dylanpaul1/), [Malika Rawal](https://www.linkedin.com/in/malika-rawal-303140160/), [Oum Lahade](https://www.linkedin.com/in/oum-lahade-920b30177/), and [Urjit Banerjee](https://www.linkedin.com/in/urjit-banerjee-81210718b/) at Duke University. The undergraduate researchers have a diverse background in computer science, finance, electrical & computer engineering, mathematics, etc.

Our team embodies the spirits of diversity and inclusion in research, innovation, and leadership. We collaborate across genders, nationalities, disciplines, industries, institutions, time zones, and much more.

We acknowledge [Prof. Brandon Fain](https://sites.duke.edu/btfain/), [Prof. Robert Calderbank](https://ece.duke.edu/faculty/robert-calderbank), and [Prof. Jun Yang](https://users.cs.duke.edu/~junyang/) for their initial organization that made this project possible. We are also grateful for the support from [DFINITY](https://dfinity.org/). Besides [Xinyu Tian](https://www.linkedin.com/in/xinyu-tian-1777aa203/) and [Zesen Zhuang](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zesen-zhuang-624591217/) served as Co-host and MC of the symposium, and many students from Duke Kunshan University volunteered to support this event for a great cause.
