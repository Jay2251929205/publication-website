Tech Solutions for the Crypto Market
====================================

Portfolio trackers, wealth management service, and trading platforms

Introduction
============

Cryptocurrencies are gaining more and more interest. Thanks to the ease of access that exchange platforms offer today, we have seen increasing numbers of “investors” hopping on the train. The trend has pushed cryptocurrencies like bitcoin to unprecedented levels, e.g., USD 60.000 for bitcoin. Amid this growing interest in crypto, many companies have flourished by offering much-needed technical services for investors. This article introduces three types of tech companies in the Crypto markets: portfolio trackers, wealth management platforms, and trading platforms. We discuss the companies behind these services and the reasons why they might be helpful to you. We conclude the article with a flowchart that guides you through selecting the most suitable company.

Portfolio management apps are web or mobile applications that offer real-time information on all your investments in one place, allowing you to keep track of all the assets in your portfolio. These apps can be beneficial because they can sync with your existing accounts on other platforms, and many of them are free of charge.

Investopedia defines wealth management as an investment advisory service that combines other financial services to address the needs of affluent clients. Companies that specialize in wealth management offer various services such as investment advice, estate planning, accounting, retirement, and tax services. [\[1\]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/wealthmanagement.asp) While these services are usually appropriate for wealthy individuals with a broad array of diverse needs, many companies now offer these services to individual investors without necessarily having significant assets.

A trading platform is a software that enables investors to place trades and monitor accounts through intermediaries. These trading platforms will usually also include other features, such as real-time quotes, charting tools, and news feeds to enhance the investors’ trading experience and inform their trades. Platforms may specialize in specific markets, such as stocks, (crypto)currencies, options, or futures markets.

We list below some portfolio trackers and wealth management services that support cryptocurrencies.
