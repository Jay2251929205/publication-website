**Cryptocurrency Exchanges: A Guide to Smart Transactions**
===========================================================

> I**ntroduction:** An exchange is a place where buyers and sellers can match and set their orders, while these can be physical marketplaces, nowadays, most people exchange on digital platforms that facilitate this process ([Kenton 2020](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/exchange.asp); [Kennon 2021](https://www.thebalance.com/what-is-a-stock-exchange-358113)). Particularly for cryptocurrencies, an exchange can be either centralized or decentralized and allow its users to buy and sell [fiat currencies](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fiatmoney.asp#:~:text=Fiat%20money%20is%20a%20government,U.S.%20dollar%2C%20are%20fiat%20currencies.)\[1\] or [altcoins](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/altcoin.asp)\[2\]. In a centralized exchange, a third party facilitates the transactions and offers security to its users’ funds ([Cryptopedia](https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/centralized-exchanges-crypto)). On the other hand, a decentralized exchange operates without a central authority, this is achieved by making use of peer-to-peer (P2P) trading ([Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_exchange)). In this article, we introduce the top 10 centralized and decentralized exchanges. Furthermore, we provide a decision tree that help users navigate to the best matched exchange based on five criteria: security, legality, anonymity, payment methods and supported tokens. We also provide examples that identify the limitations of this golden rule.

**Top 10 Exchanges: Centralized and Decentralized**
===================================================

We introduce the following exchanges sorted by exchange ranking as in [CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges) on July 9th, 2021 \[2\].

**How to choose the right exchange?**
=====================================

Cryptocurrency exchanges come in all kinds of forms, which is why it is important to consider some factors before choosing an exchange, such as:

● **Security**: Find reviews so that you know the platform is legitimate and safe, check if the deposits will be stored in cold storage ([_Cryptonews.com_](https://cryptonews.com/guides/how-to-choose-an-exchange.htm)).

● **Legality:** if possible, try to choose an exchange that is based in your country or one that you are quite familiar with ([Coolwallet.io](https://www.coolwallet.io/cryptocurrency-exchange-guide/)).

● **Anonymity**: If anonymity and security are serious concerns for you, then a decentralized exchange with anonymous sign-ups should be your choice.

● **Payment methods**: Not all the exchanges allow their users to use credit or debit cards, some use PayPal or only allow trading using cryptocurrencies.

● **Supported Coins and tokens**: Most exchanges support Bitcoin and Ethereum but some other coins or tokens might not be available on every platform ([Maishera 2021](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/choose-cryptocurrency-exchange-030226647.html)).

Limitations
===========

Even though this decision tree could be useful for some traders, there are other features that one could consider in order to choose the best exchange for their interest, for instance, cybersecurity and liquidity; therefore:

*   Exchanges like Gemini that do not seem very competitive could be preferred for their strong emphasis on security.
*   Similarly, Crypto.com might seem a better option than Coinbase, but its liquidity is lower, it is not based in the US, and has been in the market for less time so its low fees could rather be an attempt to steal some users from Coinbase.
