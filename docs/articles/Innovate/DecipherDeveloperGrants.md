1\. 1. Introduction
-------------------

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*BvldzKcxcvfex7NI)<br />Figure  1: [Grant Programs](https://cline.house.gov/services/grant-applicants)

On May 25th, 2021, Dfinity launched the [DFINITY Developer Grant Program](https://dfinity.org/grants/) and as of September 29th, 2021, the program has committed a cumulative total of $1,145,000 in developer grants, with individual grants ranging from $5,000 to $25,000. These grants are used to fund projects that can potentially promote diversity and drive faster development of the software ecosystem of the [Internet Computer](https://dfinity.org/faq/what-is-the-internet-computer).

> As defined in Cambridge Dictionary, the development grants are
> 
> _money given by a government or other organization to create a business or to help a business grow, especially in an area with a lot of unemployed people._

For developers, these grant programs are a wonderful opportunity to realize their ideas, which can support projects that are innovative but lack the funds to keep progressing.

For companies, nowadays, it is becoming more difficult to boost their technology on a large scale just by relying on their own R&D power. Thanks to the convenience of the Internet, massive technology-based companies or entities such as [DFINITY](https://dfinity.org/) are growing their ecological clusters with the power of **external developers**. The **developer grant** is one of the key channels through which these technology entities fund external developers.

1.2. Motivation
---------------

The motivation for a company or entity to distribute developer grants is straightforward.

First, the companies want to **catalyze the expansion of their software ecology.** New platforms and software ecosystems often require a continuous and substantial infusion of new blood to sustain and grow, especially in the face of intense competition among existing major platforms. This is one of the reasons why there are more developer grants projects on blockchain application platforms such as the [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/) and the Internet Computer. Moreover, these grant programs also make the emerging blockchain companies competitive in the face of the huge ecological system of the traditional centralized Internet.

Second, there is a demand to **collect ideas from external communities.** It is often difficult for platform maintainers to ensure that the software ecology is all-inclusive, in other words, the homogeneity within the platform might emerge. The developer community, however, is extremely diverse. Grant programs encourage the developer community to input various ideas into the ecosystem. The diversity of these ideas greatly complements the shortcoming of homogeneity within the ecosystem.

2\. Popular Developer Grant Programs
====================================

There are currently a very large number of developer grant programs on the Internet, particularly in the area of decentralized finance (DeFi). There is a handy website for browsing grants in the DeFi area: [https://www.defigrants.org/](https://www.defigrants.org/).

From the application materials released by major grant programs, it appears that they have similar general requirements for candidate projects, with some special requirements based on the characteristics of the organization.

**Explicit selectable topics**

Most grant programs have clear restrictions on the topics of the projects. In general, projects submitted must be related to the use of the organization’s products or expand the ecosystem of the organization’s platform.

**Requirements for project completion**

Some grant programs do not accept projects that have not yet been started, especially from large volume companies such as Epic Games. These companies or organizations have a more mature software ecosystem and documentation to help developers achieve semi-finished products more quickly so that the organization can better assess the potential value of the project.

**Project and funding plan**

The plan for project development is a basic requirement. The various stages of development and the expected outcomes need to be defined before the application is submitted. If the amount of funding requested is large, a breakdown of the allocation of funds needs to be specified.

**Biographical information and project experience**

Generally, large projects place more emphasis on the developer’s project experience. Due to the large number of applicants, large volume companies need to screen for more promising projects by ranking personal experience. Therefore, beginner developers can focus on applying for grants offered by small-volume entities.

3\. How to select your grant project
====================================

This section gives a brief introduction to a rough process of selecting the most suitable developer grant program. Figure 8 gives a flowchart for this process.

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*sri4jb560WZKo1GQ)<br />Figure  8: Process of selecting grant program

3.1. Project Experience
-----------------------

The first thing to consider is your and your team’s project experience. As mentioned before, large programs sometimes use previous project experiences as an indicator to screen candidates. Beginners need to be prepared to be rejected when applying to large grant programs and can gain experience by applying to many smaller grants first.

3.2. Platform
-------------

The choice of platform is always one of the ultimate factors in choosing a grant project. Software developers often only fund developers who use their software. For example, DFINITY only funds developers who develop on the Internet Computer; Epic Games only sponsors. Therefore, before choosing a grant program, be sure to check in advance the software and platform offered by the company you are interested in, vice versa.

3.3. Filter Grants by Project Topics
------------------------------------

If you don’t have a project idea yet, it is recommended for you to draft a project proposal by first looking up organizations or platforms that interest you, based on the topics of projects they offer. If you already have a project idea or are working on some projects, you can find a sponsor by searching whether the provider of tools and platforms you are using has a grant program, or if other organizations sponsor the type of project you are working on.

3.4. Draft the Application
--------------------------

Next, you need to draft a grant application. Depending on the grant program you have chosen, the materials required for the application varies. You can find detailed information in the explanatory materials provided by the grant organization. However, these materials generally include team information, project information, development schedule and plans, details of how funds will be used, etc.

3.5. Submit
-----------

Now, you can submit all the information you have prepared and wait for the good news.

4\. Hackathon
=============

In addition to the traditional grant programs, there is a more specific and popular method of obtaining development funding — the Hackathon. Hackathon is a type of event that brings together a large number of people to form groups and engage in computer programming, and the goal of a Hackathon is to create some software or hardware with specific functions at the end of the event.

The hackathon is divided into two forms: offline and online. With the development of the Internet, online hackathons are becoming more and more popular. There are thousands of hackathon projects to choose from. Here is a handy website for searching for ongoing hackathon projects [https://devpost.com/hackathons](https://devpost.com/hackathons)

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*_o6PqGa3svwR-f0I)<br />Figure  9: [Devpost — Hackathon](https://devpost.com/hackathons)

On this website, you’re able to easily filter the proper hackathon projects by time, location, number of prizes, and even some topic tags.

4.1. Example
------------

Here we will provide an example hackathon project to explain the general pattern of a hackathon project.

**Project Name:** Celo’s Make Crypto Mobile Hackathon

**Link:** [https://mobiledefi.devpost.com/?ref\_feature=challenge&ref\_medium=discover](https://mobiledefi.devpost.com/?ref_feature=challenge&ref_medium=discover)

**Project Requirements**

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*QjypGDx86AoGTZs9)<br />Figure  10: [Project Requirement](https://mobiledefi.devpost.com/?ref_feature=challenge&ref_medium=discover)

Compared to other developer grant programs, the hackathon has more detailed requirements for the submitted work. Figure 10 shows the requirements for this project. Similar to the developer grant, the hackathon sponsors require participants to use a specific platform to complete their work. In addition, there are more detailed and strict requirements for the functionality of the work.

**4.2. Agenda**

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*l3lSkU7E8j8cvIdh)<br />Figure  11: [Hackathon Agenda](https://mobiledefi.devpost.com/?ref_feature=challenge&ref_medium=discover)

Typically, hackathon organizers will provide a detailed schedule. The events on the schedule are more flexible and may include some tutorials on the use of the platform or software, presentations by sponsors, or project submissions. It is important to read through the schedule carefully.

**4.3. Prizes**

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*sWGC1-pjTiBmVe26)<br />Figure  12: [Prize List](https://mobiledefi.devpost.com/?ref_feature=challenge&ref_medium=discover)

Of course, you can also check out the various awards and prizes offered by the hackathon.

Besides, the hackathon is a great starting point for applying for funding. One of the big reasons we recommend hackathons is that it is not as cumbersome to apply for as a traditional grant program. It not only improves your skills but also enriches your project experience and helps you apply for subsequent grant programs.

5\. Conclusion
==============

Developer grant programs are really good opportunities for developers to realize their dream ideas. Although your application might fail, the process of finding and applying for grant programs can still give you a chance to explore different companies or organizations. This article gives you an overview of the definition, motivation, and methodology for choosing developer grant programs, but only a brief one. You definitely need to research more by yourself before applying for a program. In addition, we introduce a type of program that is more suitable for novice starters — hackathon, which can help you quickly accumulate project experience and improve your programming skill. Anyway, developer grants and hackathons are always an excellent chance for you to understand more about the developer’s world, just go for it!
